Toasterqueen12,"Y'all know that the ""xXXi_wud_nvrst√∏p_√úXXx"" flow is from Soulja Boy's kiss me thru the phone, right? 
Also this is either the best comedy album of the year or ""The Room"" of music.
Either way, I had fun.
Edit: Yeah, this is going to be my album of the summer. I've already listened to it 4 times and that's something I NEVER do
Edit 2: Congratulations dumbass. You somehow already made this the album you've listened to the most in 2019. In a year with Tyler, Kevin, Denzel, and Weyes Blood I chose THIS as my most listened album!?
Edit 3: This album is a blessing. I will die for this album. I surrender myself to 1000 Gecs.
Edit 4: yeah this will be my AOTY. I have never seen an album cater to me so hardly. 1) Versatile as hell2) Dumb simi-ironic humor3) Being Oddly Wholesome in a way4) Experimental sound I don't come in contact with irl5) Strange enough so that I can skeev my irl friends out.
Edit 5: I'm going to feel so bad when I inevitably put 100 Gecs over Wayes Blood in my 2019 AOTY List

let me start this review off by saying i 100% understand if you don't like 1000 gecs. hell, if you HATE it, i get it. it's a loud, jarring, and borderline stupid album. if you can't really handle its rapid transitions and loud edm sections, or if you just think it sounds bad, no worries! you're totally entitled to your own opinion, and don't let anyone stop you! in my opinion, i think it's flawed, certainly, but for the most part 1000 gecs fuckin bops.
i'm a fan of the PC music style and general sound of bubblegum bass/deconstructed club. shit like GFOTY, Hannah Diamond, and Product-era Sophie i enjoy quite a bit. but this, this is like... next level fucking insanity. it's like hyperpop. like pop music has fucking ascended to a level beyond our comprehension, or shifted to the 5th dimension and we're using our 3D perception to try and piece it together. some of these tracks are just borderline sound collage - gecgecgec and I Need Help Immediately being the clearest examples of this. they're barely songs, they're like quilts of sound stitched together with the weirdest fabrics imaginable. but the more structured tracks here are also super jarring and cobbled together - 745 sticky starts like an early Sophie single, before morphing into a heavy as fuck dubstep section that comes out of complete nowhere. it's demonic as all hell, and shows a darker, more menacing beast hiding behind the sparkly cover of this album. xXXi_wud_nvrst√∏p_√úXXx starts off like a 2010 house track and has sweet lead vocals, until it falls apart into a distorted hardstyle rhythm that fills the track with a ton of weird energy. you can't help but get into the groove, but it's such a jarring change every time it hits. i'm never ready for it, it always catches me off guard.
some of the more straight-forward tracks here are actually pretty great too. money machine, of course, is an absolute banger. the absolute confidence it takes to start a song with ""hey you lil piss baby"" is fucking incredible, and Laura's lead vocals are so cocky and mean i just want her to beat me up and spit on me and i would thank her. also, that fuckin chorus pops, not even gonna lie. it sounds amazing, even through Laura's weird autotuned voice. the outro on money machine is like, this weird distorted, extremely bass-boosted section that absolutely destroys my ears, but it fits in with the weird, mean, almost bully-like tone of the track. 800db cloud is beyond banger, it's a fucking earth-shatterer. the bass on this track is insanely physical and crushing, it feels like my bones are breaking. Dylan's vocal melody and the overall tone of the track reminds me of like, one of XXX's insane overblown tracks, but like even further beyond. X could only dream of making something this fucking insane. the like, idk, death metal section at the end? i'm not the biggest fan of at all because i hate the fucking vocals, but it doesnt last too long. and god, that's the best part of this album - it doesnt stay around for long at all. 23 minutes is the perfect length for a project this weird and with this much energy. i doubt i could stand it for longer. and because so many of these songs have different sections, it never gets stale. it's constantly moving and shifting from batshit insane idea to batshittier, even insaner idea. 
ringtone is possibly the most accessible track here, reading like a corrupted Hannah Diamond track. it's all about the specific ringtones you set for your boyfriend/girlfriend, and it's super cute but still fucking evil, especially in the 2nd half. Dylan's distorted and blown-out vocals sound terrifying, matching his lyrics about how after the breakup, the ringtone just makes him sick. it's a great, standout track from this album.
i've said a lot of good stuff about 1000 gecs, but it's far, far, fAR from a perfect album. first of all, it's gimmicky as all hell, and i doubt another album exactly like this will be nearly as enjoyable. 100 gecs will have to kinda change it up a little, by either getting closer to their contemporaries, or... *shudder* getting MORE experimental and weird. also, 1000 gecs doesnt have the most staying power. because so many of these tracks are constantly changing and morphing, it becomes hard to like, make a huge impact. the only real songs that stick with me are money machine, ringtone, and stupid horse. the rest are good while they're on, but not super memorable or sticky. and honestly? sometimes it just sounds bad. the metal section on 800db cloud kinda sucks, I Need Help Immediately's midi samples are boring and uninteresting, and as weird and memorable as stupid horse is, the weird fusion of ska punk, emo trap, and like happy hardcore just don't work at all for me. in the future, gecs will have to focus more on making stuff that sounds good, rather than being weird and shocking in my opinion.
so those are my thoughts on one of the most divisive albums of the year. i like it. if you don't, that's okay. it's absurd, it's loud, and it's fun. and while they clearly take a lot of inspiration from bubblegum bass artists of the past few years, they've made an album that's unquestionably gecs.

Pipe,"Oh Melon, what pleasentries await me?
So I had no idea to expect with this album. Like, literally none. All I knew going in to this album was that it was weird, electronic, and that apparently their was a ska song on here? So that's literally all I knew going into this album. I expected the best...
And oh god my ass. It burns. My ass burns.
There is a fine line here of genius and stupidity on this album. The beats and production sounds like it was created through the means of a experimental pop blender, incorporating elements of video game music, death metal, jazz, electronic music, hip hop, pop, and yes...even ska. And while it does take a while to get into the groove for this 23 minute album that could be mistaken for something that Big Baller B would conjure up. It's almost meme like, but in a way that doesn't feel hack-kneed or annoying, it's a lot more interesting while still being hilarious. And it does take roads that I genuinely didn't expect stylistically.
Although...it is hard to take this project all that seriously. It honestly feels like a meme album that would be made by fellow AOTY users, because this thing did make me die laughing the first time I heard this thing. I mean, how else was I supposed to react to a song like I Need Help Immediatly (a song so bizarre I don't think I could describe it). And listen to the vocals! They sound like they came from a lovechild of Travis Scott and one of the chimpmunks for gods sake! But at the same time, I could never say that I wasn't entertained the entire time I was listening to this thing. It has a certain meme-able quality that is kinda infectious.
Sorry for the unoriginal rating, but I've come to the conclusion that if you gave this duo a studio and a million dollars to do whatever they wanted to do, they would create something so bizarre and strange that it could be the Mr Bungle or the King Crimson of this generation. But, at their current stage, this bizarre record is just that: a bizarre record that needs to be heard to be experienced. And might go down as one of the most entertaining albums of the year.

BGL13,"thank you guys so much for 1000 followers. this doesn‚Äôt feel real. when i joined this site i didn‚Äôt even expect to reach 100 followers. i originally just joined to share mg opinions with some of my friends. the fact that i reached this level is insane.
in early 2020, one of my best friends showed me a song called money machine. i was immediately put off by the chipmunk vocals and slightly noisy instrumental. i hated the song. a few days after this, i saw that the band who made money machine had made a song with kero kero bonito and charli xcx. being fans of both of the artists but hating what i heard from 100 gecs, i was cautiously excited to hear the song. and, surprisingly enough, i loved it. since i loved the remix of ringtone, i decided to check out the original version too. and i loved that as well. i was confused. did 100 gecs grow on me or was this song just better than money machine? i relistened to money machine and found the answer to the question. i had become a 100 gecs fan. i listened to the album and loved it. i didn‚Äôt really expect it to become one of my favorite albums of all time. my family heard me listening to stupid horse and thought i was joking when i said i liked it.
this has quickly become my most played album of all time as well as one of my favorites. everything about this just exudes mindless, catchy fun. it‚Äôs addicting. all of the songs on this are so fun that i have to replay them when they end. when i listen to 100 gecs, my mind is taken off of everything that goes around me. i only think about the music. that makes this my number one comfort album. when i listen to this album, all my worries go away as i‚Äôm too focused on the batshit insane music. if i try to describe this album it will be redundant as ill just talk about how fun and crazy it is. the only way you can get an accurate description of what this album is like is to listen to it.
while it might sound ridiculous, 1000 gecs has gotten em through many tough times by reminding me that sometimes it‚Äôs okay to just have fun.
once again thank you all so much for 1k followers. i love you all so much. you are all so kind and i can‚Äôt be more grateful for the friends i‚Äôve made on this site. 
with love, ben",100

_zeltrxn17,"Is this trap? Is this glitch? Is this pop? Is this there's even a ska song? We will probably never know. But what I know, is that 100 gecs will join my secret pleasures list that I can't show to all my friends, up there with death grips.
The two dudes here have an unique way of mixing all the genres I mentioned earlier, among others in this big and odd sound collision that is the core of this album, to make some new, fresh and in your face üÖ±Ô∏èangers. The lead single ""Money Machine"" is a perfect example of that.All the songs here have a quite heavy autotune that I don't think by itself would please anyone (I can see why it could be downright awful to some), but what I really admired is the twist every song has, as well as the songwriting that I think is a positive factor to why these bangers are legitimate bangers.Again, if you have the balls to bump this in public go for it, I'll have to get used to it a bit more, but yeah it's a one of a kind experience that I'd strongly recommend.",85

KoopaToad18,"""1000 gecs"" has some absolute ear candy w/ endlessly memorable hooks, but some of its moments become a little too incoherent, or they're just not as catchy. It's also really short, which ends up benefitting this album more, b/c it's only 23 minutes.
""745 sticky"" has some wonky synth passages, & some high-pitched autotune melodies that're really catchy, especially on the chorus. There's also a transition into an incredibly abrasive dubstep drop, which although very incoherent & also the weakest part of the track, it kinda fits in some weird unorthodox way. ""money machine"" is an absolute banger. The short intro's the most ""haha gottem"" type thing I've heard in a song. Pretty much everything about the track is incredibly infectious; whether that be the heavily autotuned vocals that almost sound like synthesizers, the KNOCKING instrumental, or the noisy outro that fits well w/ the track. ""800 db cloud"" is also a favorite of mine. It's one of the loudest tracks here, with a lot of distorted synths/guitars, as well as the metal screaming that closes out the track. Laura Les's very calm bridge is very abruptly stopped by more distorted synths/guitars & one of the best & catchiest refrains on the entire album. ""I Need Help Immediately"" is the first dud on the record. It sounds like a dialogue sequence in an old video game more than an actual song or piece. It's just kind of a pointless mish-mash of whatever b/c it's WEIRD & QUIRKY. ""stupid horse"" is the most coherent song here, it sounds like a pop-punk track but with a lot of distortion & autotune. Its chorus is incredibly catchy like many tracks here, & the backing vocals on the last chorus add a nice touch. ""xXXi_wud_nvrst√∏p_√úXXx"" has one of the worst song titles ever, but it keeps the repetitive vibe of ""stupid horse"". Only in the beginning though, b/c it goes into a nice distorted passage, before sounding like some synthpop that would've been popular about 10 years ago. This track once again feels like a mish mash of random ideas, it at least keeps my attention quite a bit, as there are catchy refrains here & there. I like the computer-y beat on ""ringtone"", as well as the very lowkey vocals. It's genuinely the most lowkey & chill track here. It does have some more distorted passages here & there, but it's much more accessible than the other songs here, & one of the catchiest as well. ""gecgecgec"" is the 2nd & last dud, like ""I Need Help Immediately"", it's just 2 & a half minutes of video game-like sound effects mish mashed w/ not much cohesion. The repeating of ""gec"" also gets pretty annoying in the first second with that text-to-speech robot voice. When the vocals come in near the 1:25 mark, Laura comes in with a pretty intimate-ish vocal lead. It's not nearly enough to save this track though, as it's not like it's one of the more infectious vocal lines, & it's not backed by that interesting of a beat. I love the sugary instrumental on ""hand crushed by a mallet"", which helps transition into each section of the track super well, & each section happens to have some of the best vocal passages as well, whether that be on Dylan Brady's parts, or the ""outro"" with Laura Les. It's truly an infectious & dynamic banger, I wish more tracks had transitions as smooth as this track does. The closer ""gec 2 √ú"" has a happy vibe to it, mainly b/c of the synth melody, & the very sugary/lowkey sound of the vocals. It's chorus is pretty catchy, & the vocals are much less heavy on the autotune (sound-wise). Although the track does close out the album on easily the most pounding & abrasive part of the album, which comes seemingly out of nowhere, but happens to be the best part of the song.
Overall, I'd say the album's incredibly infectious & an absolute joy to listen to, but the duds on here keep this from being quite great in my book. I'm feeling a decent 7.5 on this album, I think the highlights are fantastic, but the album's a little too mish-mashy at times.

AllAboutMusic,"How tf do THIS many of you like this shitüò≠üò≠üò≠
They literally gave alvin and the chipmunks some autotune and now all of a sudden it‚Äôs ‚Äúunique‚Äù and ‚Äúartistic‚Äù
I‚Äôm so confused as to what there is to like about this other than some decent at best production on 2 or 3 tracks.
Look, I absolutely love experimental bands who have an out of the box style that little to no other bands would ever think of doing, but 100 Gecs just aren‚Äôt doing it right. Yes, being different matters, but just the fact that you are much different than other bands doesn‚Äôt automatically make you one of the best bands out right now. 
The difference between 100 Gecs and a band like‚Ä¶ say, Death Grips, is that Death Grips, while it‚Äôs easily for the average music listener to think their hot garbage the first time that person listens to them, as you listen to them more and you, you realize that there are plenty of things to love about Death Grips. 
See, Death Grips took their sound and perfected it in a way that not too many other bands would be able to do. Death Grips had cool flows, dope ass beats that worked insanely well with their style, and MC Ride‚Äôs vocals grow on you more and more as you listen to them, until your finally at the point where he is one of your favorite vocalists ever. Whereas for 100 Gecs, I‚Äôve tried listening to this album numerous times to see what people love about it, and their voice doesn‚Äôt grow on me at all. In fact I‚Äôd say it progressively gets worse every time I hear it.
I always see comments on YouTube whenever I click on a 100 Gecs songs, and they always say something like
‚ÄúThis shit is honestly so ass, but tbh I love it‚Äù
‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt even make very good music, but I just can‚Äôt get enough of them‚Äù
‚ÄúThis shit is awful but I can‚Äôt stop playing it for some reason‚Äù
You can‚Äôt tell me that makes them great because it doesn‚Äôt
Like I said, I love experimental music that is out of the box and pushes boundaries, but this REALLY ain‚Äôt it",13

Plats,"I have the most conflicted feelings in the best way possible. It's one of the stupidest pieces of shit I've heard in quite some time yet it's also the most intelligent. I'll just put how @acreativename described this album.
""gecs sound like solving the mysteries of the universe with a box of half melted crayons""
So, yeah. ""1000 gecs"" was an undeniably fun and instantly replayable record for me. You may love it or dread it, but the bizarre mixture of sounds and genres combined with the stupidly hilarious but catchy lyrics and overuse of autotune makes it one of the most unique records of the past decade.
UPDATE: Oh yeah, this is getting better!

nathan,"i went into this album with the most serious mindset i could have. i knew that if the album could make me crack a smile or even impress me in one way or another, i would come to enjoy the record. boy, was i in for a wild ride. this 10-track, 23-minute collection of ideas and soundscapes could prove to be the future of pop, and mainstream music as a whole. dylan and laura struck gold with their creative use of pitched vocals, which really sound like their originally pitched voices, and not just a chipmunk version of them. these high vocals can transmit emotion as good as regular ones, and even exceed them when it comes to catchiness and overall memorability. i've yet to see a truly spectacular effort from this duo, but i wish them the best in their musical endeavors and leave this experience with a surprisingly good taste in my mouth.
DICTIONARY DEFINITION: v. to push musical and expressive limits
¬∫‚ë¢ ringtone 
this song (especially the remix later on) represents the potential for a cultural bridge between glitchpop/hyperpop and other mainstream forms of pop. it's sweet, bubbly and energetic, while maintaining the absurdism of the boundaries it's pushing.
¬∫¬∫‚ë° money machine 
the genuine laughs i've gotten from laura's intro are far greater than anything else this song contributes (even though it's pretty solid). the one-liners are great, it sets a great tone and laura sounds so pissed off that the headbanging comes naturally with the song.
¬∫¬∫¬∫‚ë† 800db cloud 
besides the plain fun the other tracks had me experience, none of them made me feel the raw emotions of sadness and angst like this one. laura's voice sounds genuinely pained, and the glitchy elements in the melancholy instrumental make for tension and the clearest expression of the conformity that comes with heartbreak.

Matt,"Okay. I understand the hate, I really do, but I still really enjoyed this album.
I usually listen to a project around 2-3 times before a review but I listened to this 4 times to really get into the feel of the album, and it was an insanely fun listen. It's like it's so bad it's good? I actually really really liked the production off this album. It's not a masterpiece at all, it's just a really fun experience for me, and honestly, I really couldn't listen to these songs just by themselves, if I were to listen to these songs, I would listen to the album as a whole.
The hate it gets, is deserved, but the love it gets is also deserved, but in my opinion, it's a pretty good album and when I listen to it I really can't go wrong with it.
No Favorite/Least Favorite Track Section. I can't really define the album from a track basis, it's almost like all the tracks are just all connected to me.

This has to be the biggest change in a rating of an album that I have ever reviewed. I was very wrong about this album. The way 100 gecs bring all of this chaos to their album is not a bad quality, it's a good one. The bass heavy instrumentals, heavily edited vocals and brash lyrics make this album such an experience to listen to. It manages to find a way to have fun with itself and defy all rules of music. This album is easily one of my favourites from this year. Overall a very good album, check it out if you haven't already!

RiskR,"EDIT: i‚Äôm into it again but like it‚Äôs still not anything with much substance 
100 gecs's only appeal comes from the fact most people listening have never heard anything like them before. It's most people's intro to the hyperpop genre and as a result it's loved for being weird and energetic and addicting. Most people will listen to it once, think it's awful, but be so bewildered that they keep coming back to it, until they love it.
But this obsession doesn't last long. Once you've heard a few of the 100 gecs copycats, along with hyperpop artists that are making much more interesting, replayable music than them, you realize 100 gecs isn't that great. Their music follows typical pop structures and fits in with the general TikTok trendy music, but is weird enough to be viral. They are polarizing, sure. But their music gets OLD QUICKLY.

nino21321312312,"I remember listening to this album when it first came out and it was quite okay for me, but now I notice more disadvantages than advantages. First of all, the easily annoying autotune that often destroys the pleasure of the song. also the very structure of the songs annoys me. Although I can find very good songs here, at the same time you can also find demos here that were posted here quickly. Production is sometimes chaotic here as well, as if it did not have a constant aesthetic. It was all quite specific, but not the worst.strong 6",68
ThrowBackG,"I'd question the accolades of ""ingenuity"" a bit, as Laura and Dylan really were just horsing around until something sounded nice, but she did just call a rink-a-dink truck boy a piss baby, so maybe this album is clever. Also, Laura tried to eat her microphone while strumming a headless guitar solo when I saw them live.
What? Improvised albums get improvised reviews.",10

Pickle,"1000 gecs, an album of just 23 minutes, is the most popular album last year which was (and still is) everywhere on the internet. The album has a polarizing reception in which some people think it is utter garbage while some deem it as the best album ever created. 
To me, this album is short, fun and catchy. If I have to use a word to describe 1000 gecs, it will be big. The soundscape is huge and it kind of reminds me of an insane version of Age of Adz. The lyrics of this is intentionally horrible yet funny. The reason why this album is so successful is that the catchiness and intentional terrible production perfectly juxtapose together. 
While I think the concept behind this album is totally genius, it still has a big room for improvement. The tracks could have gone harder and incorporate more brostep influences. The synth noises here are iconic but they are somewhat annoying. But after all, it's a good album and a great shitpost.",70
reaIreaIweaseI,"1000 gecs.
Listening to 1000 gecs has got be the most cautious I've been in years. Going home in the pitch black dark of the night? Couldn't be easier. Staying high up in the air for hours on end? No sweat. But trekking through 1000 gecs for the first few times had me clutching my pearls and clenching my asshole harder than I ever had done before listening to music. 1000 gecs has gotten mostly positive scores from critics, but opinions from fellow AOTY users could not be more scattered. Even just looking at the front page for this on this very site, the two most popular reviews gave this a 100 and a 27. A controversial album? That means I have to... god forbid, form my... own opinion.
And we already discover a ton of landmines just looking at the opening track, 745 sticky. Firstly, Laura Les and Dylan Brady's vocals are slathered in so much autotune, and so much vocal manipulation that it would make Big Baller B cringe. The singing is absolutely awful. Furthermore, the end of the track features a dubstep-esque drop. You know my stance on drops. I hate them. Except when BTS does it, then it's ok. This drop in particular sounds super out of place and grinds the track to a total halt, on top of just sounding awful. Finally, the lyrics are absolute garbage. I know the bar for good writing is pretty low for most new music these days, but Jesus some of these lyrics were made almost bad on purpose. ""You take like ten tries, hurtin' my eyes"". Really? 
... Is what I would say if I was over the age of 40. Fortunately, my zoomer taste comes into full effect with 1000 gecs, and I could not be more thankful. All of those landmines I mentioned in the above paragraph are either completely false or non-complaints. The lyrics are bad though. That is not a lie.
The bad singing and autotune aren't much of a problem because of how good the melody game is. I understand that most people don't have very great singing voices, and that's perfectly fine. Logic and Pop Smoke can't sing and that won't stop me from enjoying their more melody-driven music. And 100 gecs certainly know that, because they don't even try to sing. Instead, 1000 gecs is filled to the brim with extremely catchy melodies, leading to the choruses and verses also being extremely memorable. I also don't mind the drops that appear on tracks such as money machine, and that's because they make sense. A lot of drops act as jumpscares, something very unexpected and unpleasant. But when they appear on 1000 gecs they fit with the track and by the time they appear you know they're coming. I fuck with most of the drops here.
1000 gecs features a ton of variety in its production. All sorts of genres and sounds are combined on 1000 gecs, leading to the album feeling fresh with every listen and repetition being non-existent. We jump from blown out trap banger money machine, complete with booming bass and those trap flavored rattling hi-hats, to the cluster of samples known as I Need Help Immediately, to the lowkey and super cute ringtone, all in the span of less than 20 minutes. Very impressive.
It's only major missteps are those cluster tracks, I Need Help Immediately. The act less as well crafted songs and moreso a cluster of good ideas that don't play well together. The ideas are good, yes, but putting them together just does not work, especially with the lack of vocal input from Laura and Dylan. The closer gec 2 √ú also has a pretty annoying drop at its end. I know I complimented the drops earlier but here my complaint of drops being very out of place and unexpected applies here, unfortunately. It leaves me with a sour taste in my mouth.
In conclusion, 1000 gecs is amazing. It took some time to finally click, which is why it took so long to review. But now that it has I cannot stop coming back to it. Something I've never really mentioned in my reviews is replayability, because with most things I review I stop listening to them after I review them. Even things I give generally positive reviews to I don't often come back to. But 1000 gecs is not one of those albums. It's absolutely blooming with freshness, even after multiple listens. There are way too many unique ideas and way too many memorable tracks to make this forgettable.

I've known about 100 gecs for a while now, like, since their popularity exploded. I remember the reception being mostly warm and people just being like ""it's so absurd and stupid and bad that it's good"". And I remember hearing ""money machine"" and just absolutely despising everything about it. 
Regardless of that, I would always recommend this album and ""Schlagenheim"" by black midi to everyone because... huh, now that I think about it that may have been a reason why I wasn't popular in 9th grade. 
Whatever, recently though, or well, since last year, this album, alongside hyperpop have been put on a weird type of pedestal. Even when there are a lot of detractors of the genre, a lot of the people in the community just LOVE this genre, and well, I feel like an outcast because of this. 
Let me be honest (uh-uh), I don't like hyperpop at all. I just don't know from what angle I'm even supposed to look at the genre, like, am I supposed to be having fun? How? The super high-pitch vocals are so annoying. Do I look into it and just laugh at its absurdity? What do I even focus on when it always feels there's like a thousand things going down? Do I listen to the lyrics and look at the artsy side of the music? It seems lyrics and art are the last things this genre wants me to focus on. 
I've tried multiple times with this album, and when I say that, I truly mean it. I don't know, I like the 100 gecs guys, I like Laura and the other guy, they seem really cool, but, just liking an artist doesn't make me like their art. This is annoying, even appalling at times, with so much going on, it just feels like it came straight from a meme, but not even one that would make me laugh. What the hell is even happening half the time? 
Some tracks are fine and decent, ""gec 2 √ú"" and ""ringtone"" sound like music that maybe I'd listen to someday, but then there's the rest of the tracklist. Like, sure, the attempt at doing something different is there and I appreciate it as always, but, it isn't enjoyable, it isn't funny, it isn't interesting, it isn't even so bad it's good, it's simply not enjoyable to listen to. 
I've tried and who knows, maybe I'll keep trying, but hyperpop isn't my thing. This is just annoying and I just struggle and fail to understand what people see on this, even looking at it as just stupid music doesn't help.",35

updated score 83 minor edit aug 20 2019: i'm way too tired to go into everything rn but basically this has done nothing but grow on me. This album isn't for everybody that's a given but man oh man if it hits or finds a way to sneak into your brain then wow its actually quite nice and cool. Now its also at points extremely shitposty and harrowing but thats kinda the point too, it is genius. So yeah, this is actually a great piece of shitposting mixed with extreme bangers, 2019 just gets weirder by the day------------------------original review Jul 12th 2019 (rated 55)Definitely one of the most interesting, bizarre and exhausting listens of 2019
100 gecs comes out of nowhere with a mish mash of sounds that make up one of the most unique albums so far this year, but does it work?yeahnomaybekinda????
There are definite parts of this album that are great but also other parts that are excruciating and tiring. Overall it makes for a very puzzling experience, and i do not know if i absolutely love it or if its just very not me at all. What i like here i like a lot but the bad parts are pretty bad.
My main issue is that this feels kinda forced and that it is made kinda knowing that this is gonna be whoa xD MEME music WEIRD internet songs compilation 2K19, it kinda sets this apart from other bizarre music acts like idk, Clown Core which are along the same lines of bizarro this shouldnt work but it does kinda music but pulls it off infinitely better
In general it also feels kinda everything at once go go go what sticks sticks and if not theres a new whacky thing in 2 mins xDDD
That said... What works here actually works really damn well, and as loud and obnoxious it all is at points, there are several songs on here that are actually legitimately catchy and good. There are stretches in this album i actually enjoy a lot and it‚Äôs really unexpected and it saves the whole thing from being another easy to rag on ""bad music"" album
All in all its an interesting affair from out of nowhere, but i do think its gonna disappear as fast as it came, an interesting little brainfuck of an album",92

Neo?,"I was gonna review something else first but I ended up getting addicted to this record and I NEED to talk about it. 100 gecs being the crazy experimental glitchy hyper pop duo they are, they are not for everyone. If you listen to this record and don't get it, that's totally fine, this type of memey hyperpop shit won't always be for you. For me though, this is now one of my favourite records of all time, period. 
Right off the bat with 745 sticky, you get this whiny synth thing sound, bubblegum bass, and the main thing that got me to keep coming back to this record. The catchy hooks, while this isn't the catchiest song. It's fun the whole way through and deserves to be enjoyed like the rest. Also, the fairy twinkle synth breakdown that feels like you are playing a hello kitty video game that collapses into like this industrial dubstep breakdown that's full of random noises is like the best dubstep I've heard period. Speaking of the best I've heard, money machine is the best meme song period. I will never get tired of Laura Les calling me a little piss baby and saying she's gonna smoke me like a fucking cigarette. I don't even know how to fully describe this instrumental. It's got trap hi-hats, like this country-sounding synth thing, with this grinding sound thing with heavily autotuned vocals. This song will forever be my ""I'm in a bad mood, time to get happy"" song cause I literally can't stop smiling during this song. 
That's actually a common theme with this record for me. Just nonstop smiling through every song, even the ones I don't like. This continues onto 800db cloud, which I would describe as industrial club music. Sweet hyperpop vocals, guitars that sound like they are being abused to make this sound, and soul-shattering bass make up a majority of this song. Again another crazy ending with this like death industrial breakdown that rips out my heart, steps on it, calls me a baby bitch, spits on me, and I say ""Again"". What follows this is this like sound collage thing that feels like one of those youtube videos that's like ""Guess where this sound comes from in 5 seconds"" and I honestly like it. Though it's basically an interlude so there's not much else to say besides the next track is peak happiness.
stupid horse is what 5th wave ska is gonna sound like. The bouncy ska guitars and the yell of ""PICK IT UP"" all while talking about losing all your money doing horse racing bets and then beating the shit out of a jockey and calling a horse stupid. The Hyperpop vocals and bubblegum base under this ska sound that breaks into a more standard rock guitar riff come together to just make a sound I've never heard before while still being the crazy fun 100 gecs I've fallen in love with on this record. Then Dylan Brady's verse feels like the inevitable end of modern auto crooners. It feels like a fun rap verse but with hyperpop vocals and ska guitars. This song has so many influences it's impossible to name and has honestly become one of my favourite songs ever. Just like stupid horse was doing something new, xXXi_wud_nvrst√∏p_√úXXx decides to completely buck the song style so far and just do a Nightcore song but it's an original song. Complete with twinkly nightcore synths, sped-up vocals, and production that reminds me heavily of S3RL. When I first heard this song I almost died because my young teenage self was OBSESSED with nightcore and I felt like I got transported back to 2012-2014 when life was simple and I didn't have to worry about all these money problems and other adult things. Then the track pulls a crazy left turn to show us what an Industrial Nightcore breakdown sounds like. Squeaky ass synths and pounding distorted kick drums, some sort of cowbell, I don't fucking know but I fucking love it soooooooo much. Then when the chorus comes back I get to hear what nightcored vocal cracks sound like and then the ending combines all styles of the track into one punishing section with beautiful loud blaring synths that honestly is beautiful in their own special way. 
The album's amazing streak continues with ringtone, which is this simple hyperpop, bubblegum bass love song with the catchiest hook to ever be conceived by womankind. The lines of ""I've got a little thing for, I've got a little crush or something"" and the rest of that bridge maybe be one of my favourite bridges of all time period. It feels so genuine, under all the irony and memes, it's still very heartfelt. Then Dylan Brady just drops like a guest verse with the loudest mixing of all time and I'm here for it, the distortion has become music to my ears. This song is very simple but it's perfect in its simplicity. One of my favourite pop songs period. This is followed by like, the worst song on the record, but it's still good in its own way, it just is kinda hard to listen to on its own, it feels like what you do when you come into the living room and go ""MOM SAID IT'S MY TURN ON THE ABLETON"" dubstep break down and all.
Luckily, it's followed by another one of the best songs on the record, which also has some nightcore vibes, but with more of a mix of hyperpop and bubblegum bass. The lyrics talk about people stealing their shit bringing attention to how fucking genius they are. The ass-shaking bass transitions into a softer beat as Laura serenades me that slowly raises back into the bass again is one of my favourite transitions in the record, all while I'm singing along to one of the catchiest sections of the record. Nothing super new but it's good at what it does. The next song though is anything but not interesting, the hyperpop vocals over the breakcore beat aren't anything new but the way it transitions into a more trap beat with these cute synths riding over is literally the last place I expected this song to go. Then the fucking temple blocks come in after the breakcore drums start rising further throwing me off, I literally get fucking left swerved by this song like 7 times, all with a great catchy hook from Laura. Then I get fucking abused by this pounding club beat that speeds up until I'm about to get a heart attack, with screeching bird squawk synths, the clipping tearing my speakers to shreds as am banging my head, then it just fucking ENDS. Holy crap broooooooooooo, this song just constantly throws me for a loop.
After listening to this record, I reached a post-ironic bliss state only achieved by Buddha himself. I feel so happy listening to this. The experimentation and genre fusion makes this one of the most forward-thinking records in years. The people who keep saying that new music is dead clearly haven't listened to this, and if they did and still don't think so, clearly think all hyperpop sounds the same. It's fine if you don't like this, but this is the only place where I've heard something that sounds like this. THERE'S HYPERPOP SKA ON THIS RECORD GUYS. Despite it only getting a 92/100, this album is 100/100 in terms of favourite of 2019 cause this is really special and I will forever remember my first listen.",92

RaptorMKII,"This two years, what have it become? 2019 and 2020, these new musics where noise, unbelievably harsh ear bleeding sounds, where did the era remain where talent and art was put into music? Harmonic melody? This is unbearable. Experimental, I get it, Death Grips is experimental too but it's listenable. This? What, they recorded cars braking and car tires grazing the road? Washing machine whirring? Hair dryers? The vocals are making my ears bleed too. It's a demise! And saw people rate this good. For real! What where they thinking? It's like ""Yeah I tasted the strawberry ice cream, it was horrible but the artichoke ice cream was a 10/10"". Weird as hell.",0
Vexel,"Did anyone else notice how xXXi_wud_nvrst√∏p_√úXXx Is basically Dota by Basshunter? lmao
1000 gecs is an ambitious pop album. It‚Äôs ear peircingly loud, abrasive and fun. It‚Äôs very random, with no single track sticking with the same idea over the already short run time of most of these tracks. It‚Äôs unpredictable and takes you on so many different twists and turns while somehow still maintaining a level of cohesion.
I say all this to say, 1000 gecs is a really creative and somewhat innovative pop album and it successfully blends a wide variety of genres; However, I don‚Äôt enjoy listening to it a lot. I get it, the album is supposed to be disorienting, unpredictable and abrasive, but Jesus fucking Christ, sometimes it‚Äôs just too much. At times, Laura and Dylan reach a level of earrapey vocals on this album that is just horrible to listen too. 
I also have an issue with how some of these tracks feel like they turn up, don‚Äôt really say much of anything, and then leave just as quickly as they came In. I Need Help Immediately is incredibly pointless and out of place and the song gecgecgec just makes no fucking sense at all.
I do think the production is really well done, the bass is aggressive as fuck, and it complements Laura and Dylan‚Äôs vocal styles really well.

Both make the most absurd music possible breaking the boundaries of what people think of annoying music and if im being honestI didn't like this album on first and second listen untill i listened to the Crystal Castles debut
Look im not saying they have anything in common or anything but i think that Alice Glass annoying vocals over nintendo type beats created by Ethan The Fucking Rapist Keth were so annoying that they became normal to me and it the same that happeneds hereI got used to the overly annoying vocals and production and just fell in love with it

MusicSucks,"I remember asking our friend @joaosantos about what I should listen while studying, since I didn't really feel like searching what new albums had dropped in the last month, and his list included this one. And, on that day alone, I listened to this album about three times. I was not expecting this.1000 gecs is a very entertaining release and pretty much what I was looking for at that moment. This album is dumb, this album is silly, this album is fun and this album is uplifting. It's not very consistent and I can't imagine myself listening to it too much, since it has the potential to become annoying if I'm not in the mood, but again I enjoyed it.

100 Gecs is a experimental, hyper-pop (hyper means good) duo from Sacramento i think. They have been making waves since 2012 with their production credits on No Love Deep Web (little known fact!). Now they have come out with their first studio album, and I'll be honest, I was a bit skeptical at first. When I heard the single Money Machine, I couldn't help but hear a strong comparison to Kanye West's 'Yeezus', but I put my bias to the side and gave it a fair shot. Maybe it was too weird for me at the time, or maybe not weird enough, but I just couldn't vibe to it.
Fast forward a few months to April 2022 and this album drops. I don't think words can express how I felt when I heard this. I don't mean to be crass, but I came about 4 times listening to this. In only 23 minutes, the Gecs do more than Pink Floyd, Death Grips, David Bowie, and Yoko Ono did throughout their combined careers. The intro '745 Sticky' is a beautiful cover of Vince Staples' '745', just more sticky than the original version. After that song and the single (which has grown on me like a fungus), we get into '800db Cloud'. I don't know what to say about this song, I can't listen to it without crying. It's a beautiful story of finding love during a pandemic, and it feels strangely topical in today's climate.
We're only getting started. The next track, 'I Need Help Immediately' is a pure BANGER. If this song doesn't make you wanna mosh, your ears must not be working! It's one of the most complex tracks on the album, featuring 83 beat switches and some intense lyrics about what it means to be an American in our Post-9/11 world. Following this is 'Stupid Horse', which is a surprising detour into an unexpected genre, Black Metal. The guitar riffs are dirty and complex, the basslines are crisp, the chugging is harrowing, and the drums are so hard-hitting, this is where I realized what a masterpiece I stepped into. 'XXi_wud_nvrst√∏p_√úXXx' isn't a strong point on the album, which is fair, it's hard to follow such an intense song, but it's a beautiful track about what life is like during wartime. With introspective lyrics such as ""Transmit the message, to the receiver. Hope for an answer some day. I got three passports, a couple of visas. You don't even know my real name"". One of the most original songs I've ever heard.
'Ringtone' is a strange, but beautiful kaleidoscope of emotions, with a soft guitar leading the vocals down a path of regret and fear, teaching us, the listener, that death is a bad thing. Not to be outdone, 'Gecgecgec' appears to be a simple trap song with a surprise Drake feature, but about 55 seconds in, we get a jaw-dropping beat switch, with the Gecs handling the verses. Swae Lee helps with the chorus, and almost 3 minutes in, we get ANOTHER beat switch! this is truly 'Bohemian Rhapsody' for millennials. The penultimate track is next, 'Hand Crushed By A Mallet'. this song kinda sucks.
The outro, 'Gec 2 √ú', recaps the entire album, giving us a deep, philosophical journey along the way. It leaves the listener with a choice, Listen again and better understand the strange but beautiful odyssey you were just taken on, or simply sit and ponder the vastitudes of this opus. If nothing else, the sheer amount of times this album has been replicated should show you how influential and generational this is. Artists such as Jpegmafia, Charli XCX, Grimes, Arca, and even Harry Styles have all tried (and FAILED) to recreate this lightning in a bottle.

100 gecs is a name that has been steadily gaining traction ever since the release of their debut LP, ""1000 gecs"". I listened to this record a while ago, but I haven't given a full review yet, so here we go.
This is a really good album. It might not seem like that on the surface, but it's really good. The mixing here is some of the most odd mixing I've ever seen, and honestly it sucks but I love it. The vocals are pitched up to this chipmunk sound that kind of reminds me of Fred. The lyrics are some some of the worst lyrics ever, but it's really addicting. ""Stupid horse, I just fell out of the Porsche"", and ""gecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgec"" are some of the most addicting lyrics I've ever heard. The drums are off, the music is just horrible by all means but I love it. It's pretty much just a better version of Farrah Abraham. A good example of a 100 gecs song is pitched up vocals that is absolutely bass boosted, that sometimes just decides to go full earrape. I was expecting horrible things from this album, but on the first listen I absolutely loved it. And then there are just 2 songs here that are essentially just random sounds playing over each other. This will be remembered as an insanely creative album.

musicmagpie55,"So late to the party, but 100 gecs released one of the most energetic, nauseating, and enjoyable pop albums of the year so far. By leaning into the worst tendencies of music in the last ten years, they created an abrasive collage of styles and ideas that somehow produce a coherent album. As ridiculous as it may sound, you can actually hear our dirty protagonist grow into a different (better?) person throughout the record. 1000 gecs is surprisingly sentimental and makes me nostalgic for 2012, something I was not expecting to experience so soon.
Dylan Brady and Laura Les took every guilty pleasure I had in High School and created a mutant amalgamation of styles that manages to be weird and endearing. You have Skrillex monster sounds and All Time Low self-indulgent melodies packed into the same song. The music is strangely familiar and nostalgic for a time you can still see in the rear-view mirror. Instead of updating these trends, 100 gecs lean into the immediacy of these genres. The music is trashy, but I felt like a trash person back then, so I find the album oddly comforting.
While I really enjoy the album from start to finish, some sounds are too abrasive or take away from the album's energy. The final moments of the album take me out of what could have been a perfect closing track. The music functions best when the production supports the emotional severity of the situation rather than making noise for noise's sake. They teeter on the edge of taste, but the album's commitment to a particular vibe feels convincing and exhilarating. 
While not for all, I find 1000 gecs to be one of the most fun albums I've heard this year. It lets me relive my Cascada fantasy injected with a healthy dose of emotional, drunken beats.",86

chinz,"Over the course of 2020, and especially during the summer, I devoted a lot of my time to expanding my music taste. I opened my mind up to many genres, such as alternative-rnb, folk, indie pop, and experimental hip-hop. However, I discovered one genre in particular that stood out from the others, and quite literally changed the way I viewed music as a whole; Hyperpop.My introduction to 100 gecs came when my friends at school were talking about the Ringtone remix that had just come out. I was intrigued by the line of features, so I gave it a shot. I thought it was fine. Much later, I saw that Alfo Media put 1000 gecs as his #1 album of 2019. I recognized the artists, and I couldn't believe it beat out IGOR, so I gave the album a shot.I loved every minute of it. I re-listened countless times, and I discovered more artists in the genre like Dorian Electra, SOPHIE, Glaive, Brakence, eventually food house, Slayyyter, the entirety of the PC Music label, Charli XCX (my personal fav), and many others. The Hyperpop/Bubblegum Bass genre has grown very closely to me over this year, and I have this album to thank for helping me expand my taste. I have no words to describe the impact their music has had on me, and the entirety of the underground music community.Fuck, that got personal. My bad.Mainstream audiences just don't get it yet (have whatever opinion you want, I don't mean any shade). Hyperpop will soon dominate the pop genre and 100 gecs will me hailed as not the originators, but as a strong influence.",97

I will be honest: Until now I'm laughing. The start of ""745 sticky"" is just so bad, I couldn't resist. It's hard for me to take this kind of album seriously. It kinda makes me wonder a bit too much about other people's view of music - because honestly? This was unironically terrible. That ""Deconstructed Club"" tag is just hilarious, ""1000 gecs"" in general is an absurd living joke, and its hype is impossible to find actually valid.

ryanreviews,"Holy shit what an album! 100 Gecs are a fairly new musical group which has caught many ears and for good reason. So far this year, this is most jarring and face value shocking album I‚Äôve heard most having to do with the ridiculous vocals. Dylan and Laura pitch shift and speed up their vocals as well as over-saturating with auto-tune to create a dizzying glitch pop experience. The absurdist lyrics help add to the feeling of this album sounding like a blender of ideas from pop in both the underground and mainstream, from PC Music to ‚ÄúBrostep‚Äù and everything in between. Similar to an album like ‚ÄúKids See Ghosts‚Äù this album is able to create an incredibly colorful and maximalist experience and compress it into a short 23 minute album.

Overcome with rage, I tear the phone out of his sweaty hands, shove the window open and give the mobile a pitcher's throw. I'm relieved, the classmate is in shock and the bus applauds me. Little do I know that this very phone has fell into a vat of toxic acid and, thanks to it being made before the 2010's, doesn't break...it soaks in the poisonous fluids, it lets every little chip dish on it and, over a decade later, it outgrows its slimy little tub and heads out.

LeftTwix,"I have heard the worst of the worst, from the inexcusable screeches of Yoko Ono to the killer of country, Luke Bryan, to bottom of the barrel rappers like Bhad Bhabie and Kodak Black. Hearing so much insanity in music has made me almost immune to supposedly crazy music like this, and it shows through my strong liking of this record.
Personally, I wouldn't call myself weird, but for some reason, I really enjoy music that makes next to no sense at first glance. While most can take years to get used to Death Grips, I began loving them as soon as I started listening. Noise artists like Prurient & Merzbow, even though I hate their music to no degree, I can at least tolerate their music now that I've let so much trash grace my ears. Hell, there's even some Prurient albums I love, and even some Merzbow collab albums (not merzbow solo records, I'm not that far off the deep end yet).
Anyways, back to the record in the limelight, I went into this record completely blind, not even hearing the money machine single that was so popular, and my first listen I simply had a blast. This type of music definitely isn't any high caliber music, because it's essentially two friends making insane songs for the hell of it. You could call their excessive experimentation gimmicky, but honestly I find it super engaging. On my first listen I was always looking forward to the next tonal switch or deep dive into a whole other genre, and it's consistently a blast to play.
To get a better idea of what this idea sounds like, I'll try to describe one of my favorite tracks, 800db Cloud, which begins and ends in two different sonical areas that makes the song extremely memorable in my opinion. It begins simply, which some low level vocals, but the further the track goes, it quickly starts implementing this abrasive bass accompanying the absurd vocals. The singing isn't anywhere near normal, the vocalists avoiding many normal tones and uses various tones and vocal inflection to make different patterns and rhythmic boosting to their music that only further pushes the weird element of the song. Now back to the production, the bass isn't just loud, but abrasive to the point where it feels like if you turn up the volume any louder, your speaker might just blow up. Finally, after all of that chaos, you think the song is going to end normally, but then it quickly transitions to this death metal screaming fuckery that knocked my jaw to the floor. I'll be honest, even though this was extremely surprising, this shit still sounded really good to me, and I don't really have an explanation for it. Sure the music is being stupid, but I don't give a shit, and neither do these guys. Clearly this album is just pure fun, even if it is pretty hard to listen to for most people.
Some tracks make no sense like I Need Help Immediately and gecgecgec are literally just collages of abrasive sound, but even still, those tracks has something creative and interesting to offer, and I love how for a few seconds goes by where you can attach yourself to a good melody, and just when you want it to go for a bit longer, the good melody melds into the madness and you're thrown back into the chaos. Luckily this isn't what most of the record is like, because if you can maintain an open mind for most of this record, you can begin to notice the extreme catchiness of this absurdist record.
Money Machine is literally one of my favorite songs of the year and I think I've listened to it over 50 times. The horrendously mixed country guitar sample combined with heavy noise and high pitched vocals simply makes for an extremely engaging listen. Hand crushed by mallet is an insane track that immediately starts with a great background melody, but then sacrifices it for some more abrasive noise for the hell of it. ringtone has super catchy hook, if you can even call it that, and has great implementation of electric guitar and probably has the best performance on the record, even though ""best"" is a bit of a stretch. gec 2 U is one of the funniest tracks in my opinion because it starts off as one of the more normal tracks on here, but the further it goes, the louder the music it gets before it devolves into noise insanity at the end, which always makes me burst into laughter.
In a nutshell, 100 gecs is a group that I will now be looking forward to whatever they put out, and honestly I can wait to see where their next direction is.
If it's more of this, then I can't wait. This is fuck you music at its finest.",90

I laughed pretty hard at the breakdown on 745 Sticky. The pathetic water droplet sound followed by a dogs bark is very entertaining. Most of this album manages to be very fun and catchy. The absolute highest moment for me however was Stupid Horse. It's really hard to explain, just go listen to it if you haven't already. My only issue is that I want a more full feeling project.

I definitely struggled through it, and when it finished I was certain that it would end up being a 2 or 3/10. And yet there was a certain charm to it. Something that stopped me from giving it a low score and going on a rant about how bad it is. I could see that this was an album that could, potentially, grow on the listener. So I gave it another listen, and then another, and then another, and then I realized just how addictive this is.
From a musical standpoint, this album is, to put it bluntly, is just bad. The main thing that makes it difficult to get through are these stupid wannabe comedic lyrics performed through horrible voice effects. Even after so many listens, it's really hard to sit through some of the vocal passages here just because of how bad these effects on the vocalists' voices are. And yet, at the same time, they ended up growing on me. Usually something like this would completely demolish an album for me, but here it really fits the aesthetic. I found myself looking at the album as a whole and asking myself, ""If they didn't use these effects, would it even help the album? Maybe getting rid of them would actually harm the album?"" And I honestly think that that is the case. However bad you may think these vocal effects are, they fit really well with the instrumentals used, and are part of the reason I like this so much.
Speaking of the instrumentals, these beats are honestly really good. Like, REALLY good. Even on my first listen where I hated this I appreciated these instrumentals. They're so well done, catchy, and so infectious. They really made songs like stupid horse some of the most memorable in the track-listing. This experimental glitch pop sound works so well, and it's thanks partly due to these instrumentals.
I honestly love this album. I can see why people hate this so much, but to me it works really well together. This whole album just reminds me of the old days of Youtube, back before all the gaming videos even started, when some of the more popular channels were those parody channels, and sometimes they would come out with their own music and this is what it would sound like. It isn't all that good, but it has a charm to it that makes you love it so much. Actually, now that I think about it, this is basically just meme music but they're trying to be actual musicians...

Clearly, one of the most particular albums of the century.While I don't see myself returning to most songs, I acknowledge that listening to this was a pretty fun experience.

John_Dunham,"How any actual human being can listen to this or any Hyperpop album ever and say with a straight face that it is enjoyable is beyond me. Money Machine will forever be one of the worst songs I have ever heard in my entire life. The lyrics are incredibly wack, They're voices are annoying beyond belief, Some of the instrumentals are physically painful to listen to, And yet there are people on this website not only giving it positive scores, But there are also people giving it perfect 100/100 scores. Overall one of the worst musical experiences of my life. Not even gonna do track reviews because there is no way in hell that I am relistening to this.",10

The memes of people making fun of it are funny, and I can understand why they dislike it with loud distorted instrumentals and pitched vocals, which will either make you love or hate this album.

It is truly hard to describe what I like about this album, but it is just a great experience at only 10 tracks making you wish for more.",95
hurvi,"If there's one thing I'm against when it comes to music, it's trying to define music as 'objectively bad'. That phrase, when it comes to music, is something I absolutely fucking hate. Just because you hate an album or artist, you have no right whatsoever to try and limit the enjoyment someone might get from it. That's just called ""being a prick"", and if I ever do anything like that in future, please remind me of this opening paragraph and call me a twat.
However, I'm gonna be brutally honest when I say that I fucking hate this album. I'm really not sure what I'm listening to here, to be honest. It's like that weird feeling where it *feels* like it could be something I could potentially get some enjoyment out of, but then at the same time these tracks are just so terrible to me that, with the exception of like two, I really never want to hear them again.
This is probably gonna be quite a short review, because I much prefer writing about the positives of an album than I do the negatives. However, I've got to admit, there are some things here which are actually kinda decent. Specifically, some of the instrumentals. Key word: some. Some of these feel pretty well put together and actually pleasant to listen to at times. Ones that I can remember for being kinda decent are stupid horse, money machine and ringtone. Also, the vocals sometimes actually get...okay? They feel like a sort of weird 2010s pop song at times, which actually works quite well.
The negatives? Literally everything else. I'm sorry, but I genuinely cannot fucking stand this shit. The songs sound like someone opened up FL Studio, grabbed some stock loops and threw it all together to call it a day. The text to speech voice in gecgecgec was about where I gave up all hope, and considered closing Spotify entirely. Not only that, but these songs can actually get genuinely painful to listen to at times, with really fucking loud peaks and highs. I get this is like, really experimental, but come on guys, I don't think that was really necessary.
And the vocals were the icing on the shit smeared, currently flaming cake. I don't even know how to describe them. They sound like someone just spoke into a free autotune app you'd download off the app store and then also cranked the bass up to the max. Originally I was thinking the track ""I Need Help Immediately"" was some kind of metaphor for how the duo had been kidnapped by someone and forced to write this shit but I really don't fucking know anymore. Help.
This is a short review because this album genuinely left me at a loss for words. Not like a In The Airplane Over The Sea kind of lost for words, more just a ""how did this actually get released"" type of speechlessness. 
I genuinely never want to listen to this again. However, I'm still giving it some points because I understand how someone could like this. Just not me.
Might review Madvillainy next or something. In the meantime, please send help.

combining a bunch of what is widely considered the lamest musical genres of music (eg. dubstep, ska, metalcore, etc.) into one creative, fun and short package. in fact, it's no secret that the flow for the track titled ""xXXi_wud_nvrst√∏p_√úXXx"" is exactly the same as soulja boy's song ""kiss me thru the phone,"" a song widely considered to be completely terrible.
however, as stated before, all of these hilariously random elements come together to create an experience that is very enjoyable. while it's certainly not the most emotionally expressive album, it is definitely a very fun and energetic experience, never failing to make you sing and dance along with these infectiously catchy tunes.
this duo is one of the most interesting acts in pop music today, and with the more recent disappointing release ""1000 gecs and the tree of clues,"" one can only hope that they are able to keep releasing new and fresh material in the future, no matter how gimmicky they may seem

not to mention, this album is absolutely amazing. it's a packed 23 minutes, and it's a very, very fun listen. i'll never get tired of the gec sound, at least in the foreseeable future. i love the chaotic, schizophrenic, ridiculously catchy instrumentals over laura's heavily pitched vocals. this album will never fail to bring a huge damn smile to my face.

LasagnaZissou,"LasagnaZissou Review #13
I'm waiting for the day where my brain cells all agree to collectively become shitfaced crackheads so that I can listen to this music and unironically enjoy it. 1000 gecs is that kind of album that I can praise for being like nothing else but also the kind I can hate for sounding like the autotuned equivalent of a microwave holocaust. A deaf schizophrenic must've been in charge of the autotune on this thing because no way in hell would a sane person think this actually sounds good. Songs like Stupid Horse and gecgecgec are at the very least pretty fun and I can find myself enjoying them but other tracks like Money Machine are instant ear bleeders. The saving grace of this album is the fact that it's pretty short and not everything on here is flaming garbage. Stuff like Ringtone isn't bad or good, but I of course still have a problem with that obnoxious autotune. Basically this is just music that I can't get into and don't know if I ever will. I know this album is a grower for a lot of people, but to me this just sounds like the kind of music that the kid who played ""Earrape Roblox Death Sound Effect 10 Hours"" on the school bus would make.",30
LarryDavid,CUT THE TREE DOWN AND PUT IT IN A MUSEUM,75
chaifiend,"The first time I ever heard 100 gecs was when I saw them live. They were the first opener for Brockhampton, and they brought a small pine tree on stage with them. Dylan had on a wizard hat and neither of them wore shoes. They started with ‚Äústupid horse‚Äù and I‚Äôd never been so intrigued in my life. Halfway through their set, my sister (she was in the pit, I was in a seat) sent a text to my friend saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna kill myself.‚Äù It was one of the best live performances I‚Äôve ever seen.
But the thing about hearing 100 gecs for the first time live is that it loses a lot of magic when you listen to it through earbuds. Without the bright light/wizard hat/pine tree accompaniments, I couldn‚Äôt help but cringe a little bit as I was reminded of Nightcore (I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs supposed to be the appeal of it, though). However, when you don‚Äôt think about it too much, 1000 gecs is extremely funny, catchy, and enjoyable. You just need to turn off your brain first which, honestly, feels real good to do nowadays. 1000 gecs also contains a lot of unique and well-timed sounds, such as at the end of ‚Äú745 sticky‚Äù, and on the mildly unnerving interludes like ‚ÄúI Need Help Immediately‚Äù and ‚Äúgecgecgec‚Äù. In an age where we‚Äôre so bombarded with media, this crazy album stands out and offers an escape from reality. I‚Äôm a big advocate for not taking yourself too seriously, which I think is what 100 gecs is all about. If their goal was to perplex and challenge the music world, they‚Äôve surely done that, and they‚Äôve done it pretty well.

The strange instrumentals filled with weird sound effects and stylistic switches partnered with weird, glitchy, pitched-up, and at times ear-rapey vocals keep this from feeling boring. It‚Äôs also a ridiculously catchy album at points and I‚Äôm not even sure how. While not everything hits and many things fall flat, I generally enjoy this weird ass album (...I think?).

MFC4AFoS,"The worst excuse for music i have heard in a long, long time. There's no point in it, there's no use for it. If i didn't know any better, i'd call this the death of music.
 I've heard people call this experimental, i've heard people call this revolutionary. I've heard people praise it because it has unusual combinations. Firstly, this isn't experimental, these two just have no clue what they're even doing. If this is experimental, then Simple Plan is the most unusual and revolutionary act of all time and in fact are so experimental that it would've made people's ears bleed. Fun fact: they're not that good and although people's ears might bleed, it's not because they are so out there. Neither were they revolutionary.
As for the unusual combinations, i can do that too you know. I could record my dad farting, make an hour loop of it and play various flute instruments over it while i have no knowledge of how to play them. The percussion sounds would be made up of a constant loop of me banging my head against a metal fence. Would it be good? No, obviously not. And neither is this. But at least it's got unusual combinations, right guys?
I hope in a few years we'll look back on this and all realise this in fact was just shit. A horrible excuse for music and perhaps just two people deciding to troll us into thinking they could make something worth listening.

raisi,"Ah, 100 gecs. A controversial duo, from the discussions I‚Äôve seen online and my experience showing others their music. I played a couple songs for my mom and brother and let‚Äôs just say they weren‚Äôt fans. I also showed my boyfriend and he didn‚Äôt seem to hate it as much. Personally, I really enjoy their music, but it didn‚Äôt start out this way.
I‚Äôd consider 100 gecs to be at the very beginning of my dip into more experimental music, which I still haven‚Äôt gotten into a ton, but it‚Äôs still something. I got into them when I started to look more into music instead of coming across random stuff or listening to whatever was really popular at the time. That being said, on top of the enjoyment I get out of them, 100 gecs is also an important part of my music listening journey.
So let‚Äôs get this out of the way; I can 100% understand why someone would dislike 100 gecs‚Äô music. It‚Äôs weird, hard to listen to, and probably nothing that the average music listener has ever heard. That was my experience, at least. It probably took me about 3 listens to this album to even stomach it all. But when I was able to, it grew on me exponentially. These songs that I once found abrasive turned into ones that I could listen to on repeat. As my boyfriend once said, ‚Äúlistening to something multiple times shouldn‚Äôt be needed for it to sound good, but it works,‚Äù or something like that.
If I had to describe this album briefly, which I‚Äôm obviously not very good at, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs pop on steroids. In only 23 minutes, both Laura Les and Dylan Brady managed to pack so much weirdness and energy into these 10 tracks. I feel like this is more on the extreme side of hyperpop, which is already an interesting (not negative, hyperpop is great) genre. I could even call this a little genius, making something this wild sound so good.
I‚Äôd say ringtone is the most tame track on here, along with 800db cloud, gec 2 √ú, and 745 sticky below it. And by tame, I just mean more accessible, production-wise. I feel like the production is harder to bare than the vocals, especially because most songs have a little bit where it‚Äôs just really intense and crazy production for like 25 seconds at the end. I don‚Äôt care much for those segments, I just like the actual songs, but it doesn‚Äôt really affect how much I like this album or the experience I get from it. The vocals can be hard to listen to at first too, though. It‚Äôs more the effects than anything, neither Laura nor Dylan are bad vocalists.
Songs that are more intense, like money machine and hand crushed by a mallet, are all over the place but in a good way. It‚Äôs like the most confusing adrenaline rush ever. All these weird instruments and sounds on top of these weirdly edited vocals just rush through your ears, straight into your brain, and it has to scramble to figure out what you‚Äôre even listening to.
The lyrics are fun but nothing too special. Clearly, this isn‚Äôt some TPAB important type album. It‚Äôs meant to be fun and wacky. Albums don‚Äôt have to have deep lyrics or even ones that make too much sense. Good lyrics alone can‚Äôt make good songs. Neither can good production, though. Both of those components in this record are similar enough to make it work. It would be weird to say something preachy over these instrumentals, anyways.
This album is enjoyed best when you don‚Äôt dig too deep into it. Don‚Äôt question the production or anything, just listen, if you can. If you don‚Äôt enjoy this album the first time, then maybe try it again. Only if you‚Äôd like. By no means is this an easy listen, but once a few rounds have been made, the album experience just goes up from there.

This album is all over the fucking place, let's establish that. It has overblown 808's and a death metal outro in one song, and then it's an upbeat ska song in the next. They take it as far as to just fucking make unlistenable garbage and think to themselves ""yeah put that on the album"". Even though my score doesn't reflect my love for this album, I love this album. I just can't sit and act like I love shit like gecgecgec & I Need Help Immediately. This album reflects the 21st century perfectly in my opinion, as it is comparable to all those dumb ""21st century humor"" compilations on youtube. Pure chaos in it's most purified form.

This was totally not my usual type of listening before hearing it and it really did just start by me adding money machine as a joke but,, then I couldn‚Äôt stop listening.
my favourite tracks are 745 sticky, stupid horse and hand crushed by a mallet. My least favourite is probably ‚ÄòI need help immediately‚Äô but it still makes me laugh when I hear it while listening to the full album.

proudlydevon,"FAV TRACKS: 745 sticky, money machine, 800db cloud, stupid horse, xXXi_wud_nvrst√∏p_√úXXx, ringtone, hand crushed by a malletLEAST FAV: I Need Help Immediately
Earlier I was watching a video on the history of hyperpop and I remember 100 Gecs being brought up and thinking about how I never gave ""1000 Gecs"" a listen. Prior to listening to this album I had heard snippets of ""money machine"" and ""stupid horse"" and fully listened to ""ringtone (remix)"". Going through my first listen I felt a sense of familiarity because I already have heavily enjoyed artists like Charli XCX and Dorian Electra, but this album delivered BANGER AFTER BANGER. The album starts off energetically with ""745 sticky"" that has some great vocals from Laura Les and some THUMPING 808s. The energy from this song trickles down throughout the tracklist with some of my favorites being ""money machine"", ""stupid horse"", ""hand crushed by a mallet"", and ""800db cloud"". I wouldn't say there are any major downsides to this album for me due to the consistent vocals, lively production, and the occasional clever or witty line from Dylan or Laura. I do think that ""I Need Help Immediately"" slowed down the energy a bit but I would say it was a great break after the aggressive ""800db cloud"". Overall this is a great album from 100 Gecs and I can't wait to see how they further their genre-bending tracks in the future.",84

The part of scene they've kept alive for my generation in 2019 gives me the strength to keep going, I am so happy with what shitty myspace music has evolved into, a new subculture that the older generations are now shaking their heads at.",75
YoranKaasje,"My friends wont believe that i actually like this. Which i 100% understand. I was weirded out at first too, in a good way. So weirded out that i was intrigued by it. So i listened to it (this was all in the summer of 2019 btw). And my first impressions were alright. But the more i listened to it. The more i noticed the insane detail and work that has been put into this album. Its like all of internet culture from the last 20 years was compressed and completely skullfucked to its core by the duo 100 gecs. And it is amazing. It flows so well. And it is so fucking short. But its so powerfull and in your face and it really appeals to me. And fuck no this isn't boring. Because every track is so fucking different and special in its own way.
The beats on this thing absolutaly SLAP. The opening track sounds silly, and goofy in an amazing way. The beat sounds like an vocal sample that was manipulated into this cute as melody. The lyrics are easy to catch on to on this track and its such an sing along track. Then you get into their most succesfull track, money machine. Which starts with this weird as fucking guitar. With kind off an rent from laura les which makes me laugh everytime. And the lyrics dont make sense a lot of the time (counts for mutiple tracks on this). But just that is the reason i like it so much. The chorus with the distorted vocals on this track is so hooky and also easy to sing along to. 800 db cloud (possibly my favorite) starts with some cute guitar chords and then suddendly brings you in these distorted guitar hit samples and the vocal samples that i heard were sampled from Mc ride or kendrick lamarI need help immediatly was fun for once but unfortunately it is a skip when you listen to this album in its entiretyStupid horse is an ska track. Enough saidi would never stop is sampled from soulja boys kiss me thru the phone. Cute as instrumental that eventually drops into this weird Dupstep drop.ringtone is this cute as track with a simple as sine wave synth. And this song is so well structured and flows so well.gecgecgec is also kind of an skip because the most part of the song is this weird as instrumental thats only funny for once. But then this ballad type song from laura les at the end which i do like. Hand crushed by a mallet is possibly my favorite song thats starts of easy. but then there is this build up with the synth hits when you hear dylan singing ''THIS FEELINGS GOING THROUGH MY HEAD''. Which is one of my fav moments of this album. And then the infamous: ''You circled me inside my roomI couldn't go, go, go, go''. AND THAT IS WHEN THE BASS DROPS. can we just take a fucking moment to appreciate the bass omg. So thats probably my favorite moment on the album. And the longest song gec 2 √º. I like this very much of course. It is a very fun song just like the others and the hardcore type outro at the end is the perfect way to end this album
I really hope they develop this sound into something even better because i do think this album shows that there is even more room for growth.

Houdanny,"Edit: In hindsight, I think that my enjoyment of this album was from a humorous and nostalgic place as opposed to from a musical standpoint. While there are songs from this album I still enjoy (stupid horse, money machine and hand crushed), and there are aspects of the production I think are great, this has unfortunately grown off of me substantially in time. 
o.g score: 86
This is one of the weirdest things I've listened to that passes as music. But I love it? like? it's so humorous and so out there. This is what the future of pop should be, and if it is, the world is in for a rough, but enjoyable ride.
""stupid horse"" and ""xXXi_wud_nvrst√∏p_√úXXx"" is the first time in a while I've openly laughed out loud at a song, but not because they're bad or particularly laughable, they're just so damn enjoyable. And then there's ""gecgecgec"". gec. Gec gec gec gec. WUB WUB WUB. Gec. ""hand crushed by a mallet"" has some super glitchy and obese bass that goes harder than hard. ""800db cloud"" is insanely overdone, to the point where it's not as enjoyable as the rest of the album. But ""gec 2 U"" is toned down a fair bit, to better results. It's not too obtuse to the point where it's completely inaccessible, so there is a way to get into it. 
For real though I'm surprised at how much I enjoyed something so wild, it really is a very unique project, but I'd highly recommend it for sure.

marmaladejacket,"What can I say to justify this rating?
It's so much fun. It's so exciting to listen to. My first listen ended up being 3 more repeats of the album, and I was tempted to listen again had I not stopped myself; inventive and visceral, short but sweet. It takes trap music, deconstructs its trends and clich√©s and amplifies/transforms it to the ridiculous extremes. The only thing that keeps it from perfection is some admittedly grating (but easily ignorable) moments. This record rocks.",95
chunderz,Abhorrent.,36
twitch.tv/oozePOP,"One of the most unique sounding albums I've heard this year so far. It's so loud, exciting, different, and unafraid to just be ridiculous. I hate zero things about this album. It's so fun and vivid. 100 Gecs impresses explosively with 1000 Gecs. 
This album is packed to the brim with straight to the point loud, bassy poppy powerhouses. The only thing that prevents this album from being truly timeless is the fact that it kind of slows down a bit and the charm fades just a bit as it closes out, but despite this, this album is very fun and immense. 1000 Gecs is an album that both sonically and impact-wise can be compared to Sophie's Oil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides. 
I can't quite understand where any of the negativity is coming from. Even at base level, this thing is fun and sounds sick. It's got a huge sound that can't be compared to anything, but still sounds appealing to a mainstream audience. After peeling back it's name brand packaging, you get a bunch of sounds not typically used in pop, though they should be. Every sound in here is so addicting, even in the interludey tracks that incorporate massive amounts of dissonance.
BIG. If I had to describe this album in one word, that would be. It's just freaking huge, and only 23 minutes! 745 sticky and money machine have some of the most catchy refrains I've heard all year, and I can barely understand what the lyrics are. I thought 800db cloud was a bit underwhelming at first, but the guttural vocals you hear at the end make the rest of the track make perfect sense. I Need Help Immediately and gecgecgec are tough pills to swallow, but they tickle my avant-garde funny bone, and I can't help but love them. 
xXXi_wud_nvrst√∏p_√úXXx borrows a flow from Soulja Boy, but also gives us a very familiar approach to pop... at least at first. The track quickly becomes a very dirty, grimey piece of work that just goes so hard and pierces your ear drums. ringtone is a cute bop. This whole thing is cute, but also aggressive. This album will step on your face with Doc Martens while wearing a very fitting dress.
Apart from the magic slowing down a tiny bit near the end, this album is such an enjoyable experience, and a very welcome, new expression of loud, dirty pop. Listen to this. 1000 Gecs is one of the most unique and mandatory listens of 2019.

Kal3n,"I really enjoyed this project. Holy shit this project is so weird. I didn't know what I was going into except that this is a mix of experimental glitch pop and rap? 
When I heard the first track on this album, '745 sticky', I had no idea what the actual fuck was going but I was enjoying it. Then 'money machine' came, it's intro is so comical. But then the drop came, it was so fucking good I absolutely loved the track until the end. What the fuck was that ending, not that I don't enjoy it, but it was so weird. All of a sudden it turned into a sound track. After this track I know I was diving into something really weird.
And after listening to this project three times I enjoyed it inmensely. Of course this album has it's flaws like the two track that are so fucking inconsistent that I became disoriented. But the rest is so fun to listen too.
Overall this project is really fun and enjoyable.

EntryIncomplete,"Update 2: This has more to do with how the scene has developed than Gecs themselves but GOD DAMN am I getting tired of bootleg Brady beats all over the place!! It has unfortunately lessened my love for this album, though I still like it a lot. Honestly the best the genre has to offer even as it's becoming unreasonably oversaturated and watered down. 
Update 1 (100): Spending an unreasonable amount of time with this thing has made me realize this is one of the best things mankind has ever put together. Ignore my old review, 100 gecs are God.
It's an utter clusterfuck of ideas and directions that surprisingly fit together pretty nicely. Sure, the record is a novelty, and it feels more like a joke than anything else, but hey... It's a banging joke alright. I'll be darned if money machine doesn't end up as one of the biggest, hardest bangers of the year.",89
SmooglyReviews,"Look, I can 100% see why someone would despise this for many reasons. But if you can handle Bladee's lyrics and GFOTY's spastic production with a little bit of unmm crack? then I think this is the album for you. I wasn't bothered by the influences at all, but I can see why that might turn someone off. But i think it should be very obvious that this isn't meant to be taken seriously, on any level. I don't see a problem at all with that, since on the surface level of listening it is extremely enjoyable, unpredictable, and just pure fucking insanity. I don't know what it is, but for some reason the playful and nonchalant approach they took to making this feels so right to me, but once again no disrespect if you hate it.",85
notbuzzzila,"GOOD
I didn't know what to expect with 1000 gecs, but it certainly wasn't this. I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels that way, too. I went in knowing it was one of the most eclectic albums of the year, and that's it. And yep--sure is. Didn't expect 800db cloud to end as an industrial deathcore song, but it did. In fact, that sentence could be a template for people trying to describe this album; ""I didn't expect _________________ to end as a ________________ song, but it did"". If there's one word to describe this album, it's unexpected.
I can really appreciate just how out-there 100 gecs went on this project. Like, if it desensitized its listeners so much in just four tracks to the point where it made people think the song stupid horse was just a ska song...that's an achievement. If any ska band released that song, people would be lining up outside their house waiting to find the weed they've been smoking. stupid horse sounds like a Bandetto song that dabbled in ska, with synthesized vocals attempting to mirror that of a pop punk singer from 2003. And speaking of vocals, the singing on this album is fucking wild. The amount of effects and processing that went into the vocals turns them into cryptids that have been evading scientists for years. It's batshit insane.
After listening to 1000 gecs, I now understand why I didn't know what I'd be listening to. No one can really describe this accurately to the point where someone who's never heard this knows what they're getting into. It's a rollercoaster of experimental pop music unlike literally anything ever.

CloudPupper,"I'm one of those people who really, really enjoy this album. This is 23 minutes of the wackiest, strangest, most experimental shit I've heard last decade. The samples, the blown out bass and distortion, and the chiptune, autotuned vocals never sounded more catchy, with tracks like Stupid Horse, Money Machine and Ringtone being spectacularly catchy and enthralling. This is like proto hyperpop, and the styles shown would be seen on other albums like Dorian Electra's Flamboyant, or Charlie XCX's Charli. The genres on this album include emo rap, pop punk, IDM, EDM, bubblegum bass, deconstructed club, and more. The distortion filled outros on some of these tracks are ear shattering in the best way possible. The way they seamlessly transition from genre to genre is something else, man. Stupid Horse is a ska punk ragger about betting on a horse and losing. 800 DB Cloud is a booming bubblegum bass song with a distorted insanity inducing breakdown that shatters my skull. Same with 745 Sticky, the opener to the album. This album feels like future of music, not because it's the best thing ever made, it's just the youthful energy and the usage of old music genres, similar to vaporwave. Will hyperpop be the new vaporwave, who knows, but what I do know is that this album is fantastic.

dsadsdasa,"This one is wild, wow. ""1000 gecs"" might have been one of the weirdest-sounding albums that came out in 2019. With its glitched-out, chaotic, hyper-aggressive production and high-pitched vocals, this album is definitely not for everyone. Seemingly, the entire point of the existence of ""1000 gecs"" is to be as crazy, unpredictable, and wacky as possible. If you already know anything about the genres ""bubblegum bass"", ""hyperpop"", or ""pc music"", you might be set to give this a listen. But for others, this is one jarring listen. I'll admit that when I first listened to a couple of the tracks off this record, I was fucking appalled. I was at the time no stranger to experimental music, but this nearly broke me. Unlike something like ""The Money Store"", there was seemingly no underlying theme of aggression, fear, or paranoia meant to be heard. Instead, this album doesn't try to hide anything and is pretty much only meant to evoke confusion at its weirdness. Every track on ""1000 gecs"" is strange, wacky, and glitchy. The production is almost entirely electronic-based, fine-tuned to be as confusing as possible. The music is fast-paced and the singing is completely autotuned to the max on purpose, creating something that could be considered as nightcore. In fact, that might be the easiest way to understand ""1000 gecs"". It's glitchy, electronic nightcore music.
When speaking about the individual songs, they all sound like complete dogshit because of how stupid they sound, and that's the best aspect of this album. Tracks like ""money machine"" are complete shitposts, meant to make you feel as uncomfortable as possible (this applies to most of the other tracks too). I was so weirded out hearing it for the first time, but after a couple of listen it began to grow on me and I couldn't get it out of my head. ""hand crushed by a mallet"" is another interesting song, and it might be the most consistent and accessible song on this record. While still being cheesy and silly like every other song, it feels emotional and raw. Further cementing ""1000 gecs"" as a beautiful shitpost, the song ""gecgecgec"" is quite literally just random sound effects, earrape, and what I assume as snippets from other songs? It all folds together to create such a creative listening experience.
The complete and utter stupidity of this album is what I think is great about it. I think that there will be many that will be hesitant to regard this as music because of its wild nature, but even through the weirdness there are definitely musical elements here. The entire thing is just so catchy and interesting... I fucking love it. Before dismissing ""1000 gecs"" because it just ""isn't your thing"", give it a full listen with an open mind, willing to have fun. It's only 20 minutes long, after all.

Conclusion: this album is ass and thats whats good about it",77
Ackbae,"As weird as it sounds, listening to 1000 gecs gives me nostalgia of when I used to watch meme mashup videos on YouTube. You know it's terrible, but you love it either way. That's what this album is, a compilation of weird YTPoop sounds that somehow comes out sounding relatively okay. Or maybe it's not okay, maybe I'm questioning my sanity. Maybe I've become so desensitised by all the weird sounds I put myself through with meme culture that this album is actually enjoyable.
I can't even explain my feelings towards each song, unless it's money machine, then I will admit that it's somehow one of the biggest bangers I've ever heard, and I hate it. I want my taste to consist of beautifully crafted songs that put tons of effort into incredible beats and lyricism, but instead I constantly listen to a song about having amnesia towards what an ATM is called. I don't even know anymore.
As stated in this clear work of art, I Need Help Immediately. God save us all from the gecpocalypse.

jaketyler,"100 gecs. People either love them or hate them. Don't get me wrong, this album isn't bad at all - I just think that its a little ""too overdone"" in places.
The high points on this album - hand crushed by a mallet best song here easily - are great listens. I think my main issue with most of these tracks, is the second half. It starts off as a nice, experimental song and then it gets completely overdone with awful sounding drums randomly clashing in the final halves. 
I understand that their style is pretty much ""wacky, loud and extreme"" - yet sometimes, less is more.

ljma214,"When I first heard ‚ÄúMoney machine‚Äù after watching Fantano‚Äôs video on the album, I thought it was completely trash. A few more listens after that, I realized the song was actually amazing but the rest of the album sucked. And a few days later, I realized that ‚Äúmoney machine‚Äù was far from the best song on the album. This is an album I revisit again and again for its outlandish production, quirky lyrics, and short runtime. It‚Äôs also great for some morning motivation.What makes this album special is how Laura Les and Dylan Brady take aspects of styles of music (metal, trap, pop, EDM) and mix them so violently. ‚Äú800db cloud‚Äù takes aspects of heavy metal vocals and dubstep bass and mixes them with absurd lyrics like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm addicted to Monster, money and weed.‚Äù The lyrics throughout the project are witty, emotional at times, and extremely catchy. I hated ‚Äústupid horse‚Äù at first, but now I can‚Äôt get the chorus out of my head. The phrase ‚Äústupid horse, I just jumped out of the Porsche‚Äù says so little but so much at the same time. The best song on this album is easily ‚Äúhand crushed by a mallet.‚Äù This song makes me miss 2000s pop song beat drops. The lyrics represent a unique metaphor for a troubled relationship and the vibrating bass on the second half of the song is crazy. Ringtone also has funny but touching lyrics about relationships in the modern age. The first few times I listened to this album, I had gripes with ‚ÄúxXXi_wud_nvrstop_UXXx‚Äù for its extremely distorted chorus breakdown. However, I have grown to like it more and appreciate its part in the overall album. I still feel that ‚ÄúI Need Help Immediately‚Äù is a waste of a spot on this short tracklist, but the beautiful second half of ‚Äúgecgecgec‚Äù is worth sitting through the random noises of the first part. 1000 Gecs is a concise, surprising, and wholly entertaining album with a ton of replay value.",90

TeuPai9,"This project is the definition of fun. I don't think you could embody internet culture as well as Laura and Dylan have done here. Every genre that has come and gone from the online world's spotlight is here, from dubstep to glitch to pop to nightcore to whatever else you can think of, and even some more contemporary genres like metal, all merged in 10 tracks.
With this much being thrown at you, I do understand why most listeners would hate this, but you can't deny how EXTREMELY catchy this project gets while still being a groundbreaking amalgamation of sounds. Although I'm not crazy about the portions of gecgecgec and the entirety of I Need Help Immediately that feature mostly random instrumentals and samples of various wOnKy sounds, I think they add a lot of personality and expand on the humor of this record.
I love almost every part of this and I'm sure that, if you're young and grew this close to the internet, you will find just as much joy as I did.
You will come back to this multiple times after your first listen.You will come back to this.YOU WILL COME BACK.YOU WILL COME BACK.YOU WILL COME BACK.YOU WILL COME BACK.YOU WILL COME BACK.YOU WILL COME BACK.YOU WILL COME BACK.

Sil,"I was told by quite a few people I consider close friends to listen to this album, and they told me they thought I would be interested in it. After a lot of procrastination, I gave it a listen and my first impression was that it was a horrible mess I couldn't even comprehend. Not a single song stood out to me as passable, and it just seemed like it would never work for me. However, I kept listening to it for reasons I am still not sure about, and it kept growing and growing until 100 gecs even became one of my top 50 most listened to artist on Spotify of all time. 
What do I think of it now? Like I said earlier, it is a mess I can't fully comprehend, but that is exactly why it works. The combinations of sounds on this album are something I have never heard ever before, and it provides a musical experience completely unlike any other. Songs such as 'money machine', 'stupid horse' and '745 sticky' are so captivating in how strange they are, but each still provide a very enjoyable listening experience despite all having some of the most unusual combinations of sounds I have ever heard. 
I don't know why I do, but I love this album. It is easily the strangest album I have come to love, and I can only see it growing on me from this point.

dorkist,"""1000 gecs"" is a really, really strange album, to say the least.
It sounds as if the early to late 2000s were all crammed into an album and put on crack.
And I love it.
It's got such a unique sound, I didn't like it at first listen if I'm being honest. It just sounded like annoying ear rape and I wanted nothing to do with it. But I've returned to it about 500 times since my first full listen, and I'm in love with this album. There are so many highs on the album, and the highs are really high.
As I'm writing this, I'm trying to come up with my favorite track but I can't. I love them all so much. 
This album is such a good contrast of loud, crazy, intimate, soft, and abrasive. It can go from a slow, quiet, intimate song one minute, to loud, screaming ear rape, and it's perfect.
I highly recommend this record to anyone who likes different kinds of music, especially loud, crazy, and bubblegum bass.",82

PumblyGOAT,"i truly think that 1000 gecs is quite lichrally a masterpiece. though i find the song ‚Äòstupid horse‚Äô a low point on the album, it still keeps the flow of the album consistent and engaging with new sounds every track. it‚Äôs placement is perfect, coming out of ‚ÄòI Need Help Immediately‚Äô and going from a wholesome sound into the more edgy sounding ‚ÄòxXXi_wud_nvrstop_UXXx‚Äô. even the goofy-ass interlude type songs, ‚ÄòI Need Help Immediately‚Äô and ‚Äògecgecgec‚Äô, are crucial to the album in my eyes. everything about this album I adore. the nutty--but clever--and unbelievably catchy hooks, the powerful production, the unexpected but entertaining switch-ups, and the energy of not giving a single shit about what is and what isn‚Äôt considered proper music. this album makes me feel so much. it gives me comfort, makes me laugh, makes my adrenaline pump, and even makes me emotional. all packed in 23 minutes. idc if people say it's derivative, or if it is too ambitious/not ambitious enough. everything about this album was done perfectly in my eyes.",100

bhaskar,"Edit 1:
Okay, after listening it 3 times, i came to conclusion that it's randomness, it's weirdness is it's strong point yet it doesn't able to elevate from the mediocrity. 
Also outro of first few songs legit sounds like MLG meme edits, first i thought it's literally a meme album why would anyone take it serious. But the duo has certainly amassed a cult following, an organic fanbase which longs for the weird sound only they're able to produce.",70
PatosMegalos,"""Getting overdosed on the set of a kids show""
This feels like really distorted Geometry Dash music, with some teenagers from your usual kids show on the vocals. And that's it. But it is good.The production is nothing too outstanding, but it surely is catchy, and all the instrumentals differ from one another in a way. Though, it does have some parts that are really amazing, like the outro to the first song, ""745 sticky"", with walls full of distorted synthesizers and aggresive drumming sounding like repetitive punches to the face, only to be interrupted for just one second at a time by some random, but not off-putting, sound effects, like a drop of water falling down for example. Lyrically, funny and memeable lyrics can be found almost all over this record. Nothing much needs to be said about the lyrics, other than the fact that they sure are fun, or just, simple, but not bad. Now vocally. There is a lot of autotune, it's like 100 gecs suffocated from the air of an ""autotune balloon"" or something like that. High-pitched autotuned vocals are all over this record. And there is not a single moment where they sound bad. Maybe weird for someone who is not expecting this type of vocal performances, but not necessarily bad. It is one of the factors that make this album good. Now, there are two tracks that don't necessarily add too much to the project, but they sure need to be talked about. Those tracks are ""I Need Help Immediately"", and ""gecgecgec"". They don't ruin the album or anything, but they also don't elevate it. They are just there to add a sprinkle of weirdness, and that's it.Although this album is a short and fun experience, with some replay value to its possession, it is something that has been heard before in some way, all the way back to probably the mid to late 2000's. But that doesn't mean that this is a mid record, nor a bad one. It's nice.",70

deckerd,"This is probably the most infuriated I've ever been listening to an album. They have this great idea and A LOT of talent but every other song feels like they're shooting themselves in the foot. The commercially successful songs, money machine and ringtone, are successful for a reason, they feel coherent and *fairly* well thought out. But every other song here fails as a good attempt at hyperpop and as a joke aswell.
I'm hoping that their new album either goes full on meme mode or focus the surrealism of the genre.",64

The vocals are just‚Ä¶ autotune. Not even like a Travis Scott where he attempts at some sort of melodies, they just let the autotune do the work. Sounds like when Kanye ranted about wearing the mask on stage and everyone thought he was freestyling because the autotune made him sound like it.
I feel violated. I am gaping and just dripping self-loathing for giving it a listen.

rileyegan,"There are some engaging and entertaining concepts on 100 Gecs's ""1000 Gecs"", but ultimately, the record comes off as childish, grating, and messy. Just when I catch onto the appeal of a track, it loses me completely immediately by doing something annoying. I've never gotten into glitch pop and this record hasn't won me over. It may sound unlike anything else right now, but that doesn't mean it's great by default. Luckily this record has ""Money Machine"" and ""Hand Crushed by a Mallet"" to save it from complete failure. There's some good moments, but those moments are often overshadowed by some terrible cuts.

Unbound and crazy in all the best ways, I've never heard any combination of sounds quite like this, and certainly none that work this well. While the constant over-the-top and abrasive production of the songs may be an indicator of the album losing some of its charm and intimacy. I think the writing style of 100 gecs really helps the album feel a lot more creative and fun and makes it feel like a more personal experience rather than simply some hyper pop bangers. I loved it.

Comments:They can't sing. It's just that. If you look past that and look solely at the instrumentals then it's fine. But the singing is absolutely atrocious. They thought they could just hide the fact that they have zero vocal talent by pitching it up and being like oh my god look at us we're so whacky. But it's so obvious that their baseline voices are just literally unlistenable. Again, the instrumentals are fine. But to me, I just cannot overlook the fact that their voices ruin every single song. If you have a different view of music and can overlook their voices and focus more on instrumentals then I can see why they might be like mediocre, but to me, it was a struggle to listen to this album the like 4 times I did through.",53

EyeSock,"The year is 2011. You‚Äôre in the car with your mom driving to Costco. Like every car ride, she turns on a Pop Radio station, which is playing Give Me Everything by Pitbull and Ne-Yo, one of the biggest songs in the country at the time. Imagine every stupid line, every early 2010s club synthesizer, everything that made 2011 pop music 2011 pop music burned into your brain. Now, it has been eight years. Imagine this part of your brain that you long since tucked away finally being brought back, only now it is distorted and twisted beyond belief. It is so drenched in experimental production and Generation Z humor that it is almost unrecognizable, but still has some of the magic that made that music so memorable in the first place. 
That‚Äôs the best way I can describe this album. When I first listened to it, the avant-garde nature is initially what made me love it. It was pop music‚Äôs answer to avant-garde art, and I was enchanted by it. I felt like everything this album could possibly do to break convention, it did. Many people describe this album as Dylan Brady and Laura Les throwing sh*t at the wall, and I‚Äôd agree with them. However, I would be lying if I didn‚Äôt admit that that sh*t stuck 90% of the time. It not only stuck, but it changed the way I listened to music. It made me reconsider whether musical conventions I thought were overproduced and pretentious really were so, because here were these two artists using those conventions to create a piece of art truly captivating and entertaining. This whole aura is what I used to appreciate the most about this album. 
Now, what I love most about this album is how it is a love letter to the cheesy pop music I grew up listening to, but now twisted and contorted. I can still hear glimmers of Pitbull on xXXi_wud_nvrst√∏p_√úXXx, I can faintly make out Ringtone Rap on Ringtone funnily enough. Not only does this make this a nostalgic, fascinating listen, it also makes me reconsider whether the cheesy pop music I grew up listening to was really that bad. Perhaps Dynamite by Taio Cruz wasn‚Äôt as mediocre as I initially thought. Perhaps there is artistic merit in Teenage Dream Katy Perry. Perhaps Give Me Everything by Pitbull isn‚Äôt just a dumb pop song, rather, it is a beautiful celebration and deconstruction of everything wonderful about just listening to music for the sake of turning your brain off and partying like there‚Äôs no tomorrow. I don‚Äôt even know after listening to this album. 
This is one of the most experimental, forward-thinking pop albums I‚Äôve listened to, yet for the duration of its runtime, it looks back to a time when pop music was much louder and in your face. It‚Äôs a beautiful thing.",76

JoshuaTheStarr,"100 gecs is an acquired taste and was my first introduction to this bubblegum bass/hyperpop genre of music. They were opening for Brockhampton and Slowthai and I had never heard of them so I decided to check out their music before the show and it really clicked with me. I've explored many projects in the genre now, but 1000 gecs still stands out. There are so many bangers and extremely memorable moments on this record. Personally, I understand people who have some grievances with 1000 gecs - especially with ""I Need Help Immediately"" and ""gecgecgec"". But the second half of ""gecgecgec"" really brings it back, and, to me, every other track has some really interesting production - they are never too stagnant, and there are some really catchy verses and choruses on tracks like ""ringtone"", ""800db cloud"", ""money machine"", and ""hand crushed by a mallet"". I keep coming back to this record month after month, and now year after year. It does something special and is well worth a listen, even if you hate it at first.

Kitri,"Uses many cliches on purpose, which may be quirky, but can‚Äôt be very effective in the end. The pitched up vocals also are super gimmicky, but doesn‚Äôt feel out of place at the same time. Actually does have bangers though. Very silly but very impactful melodies that are addictive multiple times.
The quick flows in ‚Äú745 sticky‚Äù are quite nonsensical, but I do like the texture differences. The structure goes glittery, hokey, and a pretty underwhelming blending of short lived samples. The melody in ‚Äúmoney machine‚Äù is wonderful, and I really like that emo delivery at that one point. The structure is actually not jagged or uncomfortable, and is a good banger.
The rhythms in ‚Äú800db cloud‚Äù so slap hard, mainly from the characteristic distortion. The pauses work too, like the little emotional singing from Laura. Great outro. ‚ÄúI Need Help Immediately‚Äù is so dumb. I get it‚Äôs jokey but it doesn‚Äôt work. Could‚Äôve passed for something more clever if it had builds off of the little idea stuff. Still sounds like someone‚Äôs first garage band composition.
The vocals are on ‚Äústupid horse‚Äù are surprisingly entertaining, because the fast pace of the instrumental with the offbeats is kinda weak. The guitar on the chorus is nice though. I do like those instrumental breaks on ‚ÄúxXXi_wud_nvrst√∏p_√úXXx‚Äù, but when the woodblock stuff comes in it gets dull. The glitchy vocals are super neat.
The rhythmic stuff on ‚Äúringtone‚Äù is very bland and so are the vocal flows - very staticky. It‚Äôs cute I guess, but underwhelming. ‚Äúgecgecgec‚Äù has more of the weak improv stuff. I just dislike its separation and how annoying it really is. The melody isn‚Äôt horrible though.
The build in ‚Äúhand crushed by a mallet‚Äù is pretty good, and vocals push its energy quiet well. I like the rhythms later on too, pretty catchy. Feels cut short though. ‚Äúgec 2 √ú‚Äù has a good amount of energy. Decently catchy, but does lose its excitement. I do love the outro.
There are instances where the beats try to be overly banger-ish, and asides from being extremely tacky, it gets its point across I guess. A lot of the fun gets crushed by the disappointing experimentation and real lack of development.

Some of my favorite artists recently come from this genre, and this album paved my interest for it. This album is just pure chaotic fun. Nothing about it seems like filler or just to be there. It's just great. Plus, it's all over the place. Not one song on this record songs the same. There's even a metal breakdown on this thing. This is probably one of my favorite albums of all time and my rating on it changes a lot. An overall great listen and highly recommended for anyone at all. There is most likely something for you on this chaotic masterpiece of a record.Favorite Tracks: money machine, 800db cloud, stupid horse, ringtone, hand crushed by a mallet",90
MiloHampton,"Weird, whacky and wonderful. One of the most eccentric, irreverent, funny hyperpop albums you‚Äôll come across.

Goobus,"""That's a lot of gecs"" - RuffCriminal
On a serious note 90% of this album is the pinnacle of trying too hard and then when they actually do make something that is good they find a way to ruin it with cringey lyrics, I get it's meant to be a musical shit post but still... Like I like the production on here a lot with the gun shot like snares and the hard hitting bass which contrasts the cheerful and bright melodies but some of these lyrics make me wanna kill myself and I cant picture anyone listening to this unironically. 
I think that 100 gecs give hyperpop a bad name and are halting the progression of the genre.",40

Trev127,"This album is a cry for help disguised as garbage.
Edit: I don't know why I've been listening to this a lot lately, so here's a legit review. I have never done drugs (and I never plan on it) but I would assume this album is how it would feel to do drugs in music form. It's looked down upon by society, but when you try it, you get addicted to it. I listened to Money Machine out of curiosity once and thought it was terrible, but couldn't stop coming back to it because of its absurdity. Eventually, I listened to the entire album and actually thought it slapped. I think because of the fact that there isn't much music that sounds like this (I'm sure in the future, there will be a lot more of this) that is why people are getting addicted to it. I freaking hate the fact that I really like this album. It is the most chaotic and fast-paced album I have ever heard. It's like injecting sugar straight into your bloodstream. It's like drinking a super sweet drink until you get a sugar high. I don't know what else to compare it to, it's just so freaking hyper and stupid.

starbepis,"This album is the wackiest shit I‚Äôve ever heard, but that just serves to make it one of the purest ‚Äúdumb fun‚Äù albums I‚Äôve ever listened to. The off-the-wall creativity is something to behold, and the core songwriting is genuinely great. Underneath the layers of distortion, Auto-Tune, and sheer ridiculousness, you get some of the best pop songwriting of 2019. I mean, it‚Äôs no Charli, but the fact that this album helped significantly to propel hyperpop into the spotlight is something to be noted. But, what about the songs? They are addictive, energetic, and even... wholesome? Take the closing track ‚Äúgec 2 u‚Äù, which explores a surprisingly touching love story, with their signature chipmunked vocals and distorted pop instrumentation. On the flipside, we have ‚Äú800 db cloud‚Äù, a song with heavy distortion and lyrics heavily referencing weed and addiction in general, and ‚Äúmoney machine‚Äù, which seemingly insults the listener with some choice lyrics that you simply have to hear for yourself, if you somehow haven‚Äôt. Hell, I‚Äôve seen t-shirts bearing with the lyrics to this song. If you think you have a high tolerance for weirdness in modern pop, this album is a must.",82

CeaTeeReviews,"Lyicism A-Beats/Production B+Flows/Delivery AContent A+Creativity B+Replay Value B-‚Ä¢At first the length of this album scared me. 25 tracks and 1.5 hours long. In all honestly I really don't have a problem with the length. Yes it takes forever to get through the album. Aside from just a few tracks, I'm impressed with Born 2 Rap front to back. The features also scared me a little bit before listening; a ton of unknowns, some pop stars... Chris brown.... and even a contestant from the Netflix Contest show ""Rythm And Flow"". I'm talking about D Smoke. Surprising, he had one of the best guest verses on the entire album on the track ""Cross On Jesus Back"". Anderson .Paak shares the track ""Stainless"" with Game. This track is crisp, funky, trip. I've had this in loop since it dropped as a single weeks ago; and that golden hook! I'm not usually a 21 Savage fan but he's so smooth on ""The Code"".One of the best tracks on the album' features Nipsey Hussle, ""Welcome Home"". I have it in my ear now...goosebumps still! It's not even because he passed. His verse is extremely compelling and full of energy. The way Nipsey and Game go back and fourth is legendary. The next 2 tracks relate to this one. ""Help Me"" is an interlude where Sly sings 'Can't believe I have To Say Goodbye', which fades into the song ""I Didn't Want To Write This Song"". It's a deep, thoughtful retrospective sort of tribute to Nipsey Hussle.""Roadside"" Ft. Ed Sheeran is the album's closer. It's one of the most impactful Game songs I've ever heard. Game bounces the idea of death around in his head. It humanizes him so much to see him show a sense of worry. The simple stripped back guitar strings give the track a very melancholy atmosphere. Ed sheeran sings a very heartfelt hook that works amazing with the strings. I never imagined that Ed Sheeran would be opening and closing Game's last album. Stranger than that, I never imagined it would fit so well.Overall I'm impressed. The album does a lot of reminiscing while also showing us new sides of Game. It's a consistent addition to his discography. I can't help but hope he has just 1 more in him",75

ItzProMusic,"This album is something that you never thought you would hear in your lifetime. 1000 gecs succeeds in being incredibly influential to a new wave of hyperpop music while also being experimental, fun, boundary pushing, and comical. It really accomplishes a whole lot. The production is also a lot more complex and ambitious than their 100 gecs EP. However, listeners have to escape their bubble of fun and realize just how bland the lyricism and singing is. I don't think this album was intended to be very lyrical or to show off their songwriting though. Also there are some points that try WAY too hard to be random and different that it just comes out rather unenjoyable on songs like I Need Help Immediately. Just a heavy distortion does not mean experimental btw which is something that I think listeners need to get through their brains. Still, I think it's one of the boldest albums EVER. I wasn't too sold at first, but it really grows.",74

Koan,"Charli + cringe - charisma = 100 gecs
This is a case of ""weird"" artists being unpretentious while having talent. It's cool how they mix all these elements, but it's just cringey how stupid the result turns out to sound. That's kind of the point and I do get it... But just because your point is making something half-ironically stupid doesn't mean you're gonna be successful at it. Even despite the freshness of the sound, it feels samey and like something I've cringed to before. It's supposed to be a vibe? Cuz' I'm not vibing after the 2nd song... Is it suppposed to be funny? Guess I'm harsh audience... Idk, I'm not even super hateful about it honestly, but it doesn't stand out that much to me even for being experimental or provocative and don't really get what people might be getting about this album that's so ""iconic"".

Despite that, this is some real-ass-evil-juvenile-merry-Sesame-Street-Hello-Kitty-gourmet-hyper-fo-shiz and brings out the inner pain-loving-masochistic-type. I am certain there are ulterior motives behind this project. For starters, it‚Äôs on-the-dime the same length as most children‚Äôs television shows run for. Laura‚Äôs vocals are autotuned to be high and squirmish, a stylistic choice? Wrong. Sounds like a goodman character in a--perhaps children‚Äôs show, or cartoon? Coincidence? That‚Äôs what I thought. It‚Äôs probably some evil virus to show the capitalism-political motives in advertised television, which is why it sounds as if the white part of a barcode was sung. And also why things frantically transition from jittery verse to dubstep-thrust, it represents the corruptness in those shows. I know what you‚Äôre going at, little gecs.",68

BruhJoshHill,"A surprisingly catchy and listenable amalgamation of abrasive and headache-inducing sounds. Although it is just a meld of weird and wacky sounds which don‚Äôt work together at all, I can‚Äôt help but listen to this album and actually have a good, fun time, especially when enjoying it with friends. However it could‚Äôve been longer, 23 minutes isn‚Äôt enough time to do much and each song is a bit too short to properly enjoy it too.
Overall, this album is an odd but surprisingly enjoyable gem in the often muddled and bad-sounding experimental/weird genre.
I‚Äôve given it 70 but not in the same sense as I‚Äôve given to other songs and albums. The 70 I‚Äôve given this is not the same 70 I have given other albums as this album is not comparable to them, meaning this album isn‚Äôt necessarily better than one with a lower score.",70
DARKFANTASY,"I usually have really mixed opinions abou bubblegum bass and glitch music in general. And this maximalist album is one of the worst i have heard in my life, it is in no way catchy or innovative since alot of ppl are already doing this shit way better.
I appreciate the unpredictability of the album and the songs with weird ass beat drops, but not only the mixing is weak. The vocals are moslty obnoxious and the lyrics are really fucking bad overall. I totally despise this shit.
I can appreciate this when it comes to finding charisma and a linearity on this, and it is funny for some moments, but bubblegum bass needs to be done well, the mixing needs to be catchy innovative and interesting in order for it to be acceptable and funny to go through, and sadly that isn't the case on this project. The best thing about the album is how weirdly placed some sounds effect can end up sounding after all on songs like I Need Help Immediately for example. Where we truly get surprised by the sound that is being produced here, turning this out to be an interesting trip. But at the end this is extremely annoying most of the times.",29

Aidan_Sun,"This album is much more interesting than good. I don't really understand the reason anyone would listen to any of these songs. Yes, some songs are good, and while every song sounds like complete dogshit it is undeniable that the production of this album is top tier. This album is much more of a show of potential of the duo than anything. If 100 Gecs decided to make music that wasn't equivalent to a shitpost (such as the final two tracks) they would be unstoppable. I actually had seen them when they opened for Brockhampton, which is the reason it took me so long to get around (they sounded awful in my opinion). I hope that they actually start making serious music, and if they stick to this neo-crunkcore i hope they make it less of a pain to sit through. The only real appeal i could see this having is the irony of it and it appealing to early 2010s nostalgia. I've definitely heard worse and I honestly look forward to what they make in the future, but otherwise this album is just not that good",44

j_valente23,"Yes, it's a pretty good pop album, I have some problems with the vocals and with the sounds, because yes, it is strange and I had to listen several times before I really enjoyed it. I wished ringtone and gec 2 U remixes were in this album in the place of the originals, ringtone was a music without flavor, and the remix it's lit.
Still, Dylan Brady and Laura Les made a good job.

fleuress,"This entire album sits right on top of the line between being stupid in an enjoyable way and being stupid in an unbearable way. I mostly enjoyed it besides the incredibly loud sections in some songs like the ones in money machine and 745 sticky, but there's enough genuine bangers in this album to make up for it. Excited to see what's next for this group.",70
limforty,"before this came out i had no idea who these guys were, but my friends kept talking about this album, so i figured i'd listen. goddamn was i blown away. from the first song i had a goofy smile on my face, and it persisted. the production is batshit insane but also awesome, with the bass and distortion providing contrast to the myspace era melodies, like on ""xXXi_wud_nvrst√∏p_√úXXx"". but what surprised me most was how addicting this was. this album latches on to you, and its eccentricities become it's strong points. the autotuned vocals show an obvious pc music influence, and with umru's involvement it's clear this is an extension of the pc music sound. however, this is the pc music sound if you deep fried it and smashed into pieces. overall the biggest surprise for me so far this year, and i will definitely listen to whatever they're doing next.",87

NicoEsparza,"Alright this isn‚Äôt ‚Äúabsolutely a meme‚Äù it‚Äôs actually pretty good and I like it, hand crushed by a mallet, stupid horse, and money machine are my favorites.
Original rating: 73/100Original review:I know 100 gecs says they aren‚Äôt a meme but 1000 gecs is absolutely a meme and it‚Äôs done pretty well for what it‚Äôs trying to do. I went into this totally blind and I‚Äôm glad I did because I did not anticipate this and not much could have prepared me for it. Because this is a meme, this is subject to a different type of criticism not used on ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù projects. I‚Äôm going to listen to some of these songs on here that are relatively palatable because they sound cool like money machine, 800 db cloud, stupid horse, ringtone, gecgecgec, hand crushed by a mallet, and gec 2 √ú. I think the rest still work well to support the album in what it‚Äôs doing but if you take away the meme factor they‚Äôre just horrific compositions. Besides that, the rest sorta grow on you. I might change my rating in the future if it clicks or something or if my opinion changes. I'm sure Big Baller B and 100 gecs probably traded some inspiration too.",78
JiruPiru,"Really fun album. Definitely not for everyone but if you like experimental music, you'll love this. Has a few pop elements, especially in the simplistic lyrics but the instrumentals are where this album shines through, for me. The instrumentals are full of various genres, ranging from metal to elements of noise music.",80
sumant,"fuck it.this album is near perfect. there is nothing that makes me laugh so much, i literally cannot sit still when any song (besides the interludes) play. every song is packed with so much energy and fun. every night after 12am my brain decides it would be a good idea to listen to this and laugh for 23 minutes straight.

Fav tracks (i don't love these but they're alright i guess): Ringtone (actually kinda good it's cute and doesn't/ annoy me as much but the parts that are trying to be ""experimental"" and ""loud"" and ""different"" are just obnoxious annoying loud for no fucking reason trash ), Money machine (kinda catchy but again i fucking hate when it's trying to be edgy and expiremental like wtf is that ending it's just loud noise it adds nothing to the song)

EndSpectrum,"grew on me every listen since the first. this shit is magical. an exploration of abandoned, shit on internet fads and concepts revitalized and brought to light in the name of not caring what anyone thinks of you, and your own forward thinking push. or more so collision. of course, ideas and concepts alone don't get you a 10/10. the hooks and melodies on this are infectious, the instrumentals are energetic; a blast of creativity straight through the skull, and it is endlessly replayable. their gimmick that some complain about, i think creates a memorable experience, and never gets old. few albums i've heard explore as much ground as this so sporadically, and in only 23 minutes. i genuinely am hoping that this is remembered as an important album, though it's far too early to say. but what i know for sure is i love this album with all my heart and that is going to stay. more of a ramble then a review but whatever. gec.",100

EDIT: After coming back to it, attracted by how cool the fandom for the band is, I can say I now enjoy this album. It's still not my cup of tea, but I can appreciate it. Personal favorite: Stupid Horse, which sounds a lot like some of the old Blink 182 songs back in the day. I genuinely like ringtone too. PD. that's one dope tree in the cover",77
Yaysuz,"Continuing the month of May....
100 gecs is a band that I don't understand. In my opinion, I see them in the same way that I see PSY and other novelty acts - after the first listen, their quickly lose their appeal. 100 gecs is no exception to this. I don't care what post-ironic excuse you make, listening to 100 gecs is a genuinely dizzying and confusing experience, which is something that I usually don't want to. I never really find myself saying ""You know what, I could really use some distorted bubblegum bass crossed with cocaine right now!"". This will probably be the last 100 gecs album I'll listen to.

Starr,"This project has all the makings of a musical shitpost. However, it is unironically one of the most oddly charming, vibrant, catchy, and exciting Pop/Trap projects I've heard all year.",80
DeadeyeRaccoon,"I don't really know how to feel about this album. Whenever it is at its worst, it is downright obnoxious and annoying. Whenever it is at its best, it can actually be quite sweet and fun. People are calling ""1000 gecs"" a comedy album, which is true, but also the worst thing you could possibly call it, because the comedy sucks. This album's comedy is the equivalent of the one annoying dickhead who spurts out random memes and can't read that everyone in the room hates them. If I were to review this album solely off being a comedy album, it would be a 0. 
For the purpose of this review, I'm looking at this project purely from a musical standpoint. From this position, I'm completely neutral on the album, and look at this sort of on a case-to-case basis. Some of the tracks here I really enjoy, especially tracks like ""ringtone"" and ""hand crushed by a mallet."" They aren't so overbearingly over-the-top as the rest of the album, and are actually quite nice to listen to on their own, and feature their own artistic qualities that separate them from the rest of the project. When this album slips, it slips into a bottomless canyon. ""I Need Help Immediately"" is one of the worst interludes I've ever heard, ""stupid horse"" is, well, stupid, and ""xXXi_wud_nvrst√∏p_√úXXx"" is a pathetic, one-dimensional attempt at parodying EDM. The rest of the album is pretty mediocre - a forgettable collection of tracks that muddy together, but aren't necessarily ""bad.""
Overall, I don't get the hype surrounding 100 gecs. To me, while there are some redeeming qualities to their music, they seem so hopelessly arrogant that they essentially throw whatever outrageously hideous sounds they want into a ""comedy album"" just to put on the guise of being artsy and creative. Albums that are legitimately experimental, genre-pushing, or legitimately funny novelty pieces simply spit on this album, as while it may hold up on the back of its few great tracks, it utterly fails to provide any meaningful innovation or message on music.",50

TheSmokyWalrus,"Autotune: Gone Wrong
1000 gecs is easily one of the strangest albums I've heard this year and that's for good reason. The album hardly sticks to a certain genre, jumping from trap to dubstep to death metal to even ska. One defining trait of this album is the overbearing autotune. For some reason, people don't mind it? The autotune is hardly well utilized and is really more of a nuisance than an artistic effort. 
Also, throughout the album is extremely distorted bass, which only add to the collection of unnecessary sounds in a single track. The lyrics are either extremely basic or extremely stupid. And just to clarify, I'm all for experimental and weird music, but this just feels just random for LOL sake. 
Now I do appreciate the creative effort 100 gecs went for, but I just feel experimental music doesen't always mean the music will be good. A few cuts here are actually catchy, probably because of the repetitive lyrics. I just think the autotune completely ruins this album. The autoune is so utilized, Laura and Dylan start to sound like actual robots, which even if it was intentional it does not work. Maybe I'm not seeing the full picture of this album, but all I see is a mish-mash of several genres with extreme bass and irritating autotune.

KRMLN,"1000 gecs is one of my favourite record of the year. The sound of it is so unique, and fresh, that I can't think any other album that sounds like this. Probably because the tracks are so different from each other in genre. For an example 745 sticky, is starts like an experimental sounding rap/pop, and then in the end, It's a hardcore dubstep. What makes 1000 gecs good for me, that the creators is parodizing every genre they use, and also riding the wave of it. It's not an album you can show to everyone, probably. Cause every track vocals are pitched in almost chipmunk voice and people are not used to this, and cause of the wierd sounds they use in almost every track. BUT, It's only helps the songs to be more musical. I listened to the STEMs of the album, and without vocals, the only remaining elements of the songs, are drums and a few electronic-like sounds(e.g. hand crushed...). So, I can say that the vocal are also used as another instrument, which is amazing. Overall I'm addicted to this album, and I'd love to hear more music from this group.

Did someone put a vocoder in a washing machine along with a copy of the first Aqua album just to see what would come out? At this very moment I still don't know exactly where I fall on the scale. This album is a shitpost, but one that entertained me I have to admit. The vocals at time just seem intentionally awful, as no one would look at those recordings and say ""Nailed it!"". This is all calculated which makes me intrigued at the end game of this whole experiment. I can't recommend this and at the same time I want to just to see people's reactions. Bottom line...I had fun, I guess.",65

I have not felt this conflicted in a long time about a record- the highs were amazing and made me love this project, while the lows made me want to rip my headphones off and throw them across the room. The distorted vocals hit correctly only when the songwriting lines up- which isn't as often as I want on this record. I will say the Soulja Boy hook on xXXi_wud_nverstop_UXXx is hilarious but then the bizarre breakdown is one of those headphone tossing moments. I am still confused and torn.

midnightbabe,"Alright... here's my final thoughts on this. I wanted to go back and listen to it to get ready for the remix album, and honestly it's much better than what I remembered. This is just 10 tracks of absolute musical chaos. It's a really fun project with a lot of heart and personallity, and a really interesting start to a really weird group. 
While I originally found songs like stupid horse or gecgecgec a little grating based on just how whiny the production was, nowadays I think it works in its favor to make the whole album a cohesive experience, from start to finish. I'm still fascinated by the experimental parts of the album too, like the noisy ass percussion on xXXi_wud_nvrst√∏p_√úXXx, which sounds like something you'd hear on a youtube tutorial on 2008, specially because of that Soulja Boy interpolation.
A lot of the album is kinda nostalgic in a way, reminding me of old dance-pop and cheesy electronic music from last decade, but thru PC Music lens. This album is maddening but It's also infinitely catchy and fun. Great music to just lose your mind to, and I think we all need that every once in a while right?

cfreemon,"Imagine if Soundclown and YouTube Poop had a child, and it was raised in a domestic partnership of post-2016 Charli XCX and Sophie. That kid must've had a hell of a childhood! 100 gecs is that child, and their debut album is a frenetic mix of glitch, pop, noise, hardstyle, synth, and more. When the duo is singing along to their more polished tunes rather than throwing noise around like bombs, it's a pretty great experience. It's one of the most creative things you'll find to in 2019.
Right from the get go you can see how oddball this album is gonna be. ""745 sticky"" starts out ""innocuously"" enough, with some autotune vocals over a electro-trap beat, but halfway through the hints of big EDM give way to hardstyle dubstep that mixes in samples from every corner of the world. Screams, pots, pans, dogs, and finally a police siren welcome you into the wild world of 100 gecs. Further in, you get bizarro sound collages like ""I Need Help Immediately"" and the intro to ""gecgecgec"", which distorts Microsoft Sam's voice saying ""gec"" over and over again. These more wild moments tend to distract from the better melodic moments. ""800db cloud"" starts out banging albeit with silly lyrics about smoking dope, but devolves into unintelligible black metal-tier throat screaming at the tail end. The aforementioned ""gecgecgec""'s intro is weirdly entertaining and not as egregiously obnoxious as other noisey moments, but it doesn't serve the great outro singing at the end of the track very well. The overall placement of these abrasive moments could use more thought, and without intent they just feel obnoxious. Luckily the songs are short, and any terribly obnoxious moment is over quickly.
It's on the less noisey songs that 100 gec's style really shines. ""money machine"" plays like a much more conventional pop song, but with glitchy production and braggadocios lyricism that makes the band stand out. The vocals are a little muddled but I love the attitude it brings regardless. ""ringtone"", in an alternate world, would've fit right in on Charli XCX's Pop 2, with croons about connections with significant others in the digital world. This digital longing also shows up on ""xXXi_wud_nvrstop_UXXx"", perhaps the best mix of experimental and conventional. The soft, trembling intro does a complete 180 into dubstep midway through, yet the two mix beautifully at the climax of the song. It reminds me of those late 2000's Basshunter or Manian tracks, but done much better. The closer ""gec 2 U"" is another awesome mix of the weird production with a more standard pop rhythm, and the beat flows well into the hectic electronic finish. And then there's ""stupid horse"", a crazy mix of ska and glitch about losing money on a horse race. It's gonna go down as one of the more underrated bangers of 2019, and I can't get enough of the glitched out guitars on the track. These better songs move along quickly but never feel slight, packing in a lot of energy and color into their short runtime.
Experimental pop music is always hit or miss, but the hits on 1000 gecs are right up with the best of the best. 100 gecs' style can be a lot of fun when put to the right production, and if they give the more noisey moments intent, they could be the next big thing in experimental pop. And even if they aren't, they mixed ska and glitch together like no one's business. They didn't have to go that hard, but they did it anyway. 
Standouts: money machine, stupid horse, xXXi_wud_nvrstop_UXXx, ringtone, gec 2 U",73
BrandyBigos,"On the first listen, this was an absurdly fun album that kept my attention for the entirety of its short runtime. After multiple listens, the high points got higher, while the low points proved to only have first listen novelty, eventually becoming flat out skippable. The parts that do work for me are the kind of blown-out, over saturated pop that I‚Äôve been looking for more of since the first Sleigh Bells album. The parts that don‚Äôt work for me are the interlude tracks and genre changes that break up the flow of the album and beg to be skipped so I can get right back into more of the pure pleasure stimulus that I came here for. 
With that being said, this being the debut album released by 100 gecs makes me very excited for future releases by the group.

Schmoobin,"""I can't let anybody know that I really like this album,"" I type as I publish this review for the whole world to see.
I remember the first time I heard a song off of here. Somebody recommended me ""800db cloud"" on Instagram. I listened to a little bit of it and enjoyed it. It was a weird experience, but I didn't hate it. Fast forward a few weeks later and I keep repeating this damn album. There's just something so captivating about it. Maybe it's the heavily produced off-kilter yet charming vocal style from Dylan and Laura. Or maybe it's the insane production that really makes this album what it is. Every song on here is unique, and gives me a different feeling. ""stupid horse"" and ""xXXi_wud_nvrstop_UXXx"" sound extremely different from each other, yet they're right next to each other on the album. There's a lot of trap influence on this album, but it blends well with the punk, alternative, and dubstep elements of this song. Hell, ""stupid horse"" is pretty much a ska song, and probably the only ska song I'll ever come back to. Take that Aquabats!
Let me address the elephant in the room. This is indeed meme music. However, it's not the kind of meme music that's purposely bad like ""NoStockingz."" This album is probably something closer to ""Exmillitary,"" They don't make anything on here purposefully bad, but there's still a heavy element of memability on this project. There are areas on this album where you know the group is just memeing and just poking fun. Take the intro to ""money machine"" for example. The song starts off with ""Hey, you lil' piss baby, you think you're so fucking cool? Huh?"" I remember that intro caught me off guard and confused me, just like the intro to Guillotine, where MC Ride just mindlessly yells ""It goes it goes it goes it goes guillotine!"" A better example of the group just messing around and memeing is ""I Need Help Immediately,"" where I'm pretty sure one of them just went on Garage Band IOS, started violently slapping at the screen, and called it a day. 
As much as I love this project, this definitely isn't for everyone. I wouldn't ever in my life recommend this album to any of my friends. As long as I enjoy it, I'm fine.

paigetheclever,"Having read a few entertaining reviews, I dove in ready to hate this album. Instead I listened to it six times that night and have been bothering my neighbours with it ever since. 
Yes, it's a meme album. But it's also tapping into a corny-but-wonderful 2000s pop vibe mixed with the wildest whirlwind of electronic influences. The lyrics are cringey in multiple ways, from their absurdity to their sentimentality, but the self-awareness and throwback value balances it out. 
Most importantly, the album is so striking and hilarious that it has become something outside of the music itself. Perhaps it's only meme madness, but I've had more fun with this album than any other released this year.",82
JohnnyB1965,"SUPER RELISTEN REVIEW DELUXE EDITION - Wow, what a journey I've taken with this album this year. I first heard it and just despised it beyond belief. I thought it was weird, annoying, and dumb. And at face value, it totally can be dumb and weird. Yet, that's the real fun of this album. It is wild and just goofy sounding at times. But, I just couldn't get Stupid Horse out of my head and went ahead and listened again... and again... and again... just like I said before. I've even made it a point to listen to 745 sticky on my morning walk to class right around 7:45. It's just so, so much fun. Never could I have predicted that this insane and strange album would become one of my absolute favorites of the year. Every time I listen, it's like I've been teleported to some weird purpleish pink world where everybody is head banging and the bass punches you right in the face. One of the most genuinely interesting and fun experiences I have ever had with an album. Not many times do I listen to something and think, ""I have never, ever heard anything like this before."" Yet, here we are.
REVIEW REDUX: SCORE 85 - When I first listened to this I thought it was beyond terrible. However, I couldn't get that goddamn Horse song out of my head. Then I found myself wanting to listen to that song again... Then I just decided to listen to the whole album again... and then one more time... and... you get the idea. I have now kinda fallen in love with this album despite how completely batshit absurd the whole thing is. I can't wait for 1,000,000 gecs.

timelybentl,"Hey, do you guys remember Jamsters? Like those ads that would air at 4 AM with a morbid little CG animal that begged you to text ""LOVE"" to 850224 so that it can scream at you anytime anyone tried to call you? Well, they formed a musical group called 100 gecs they're fucking PISSED now. Like, oh my god, what did you do? Well, whatever it was, you gotta patch things up because this is not okay by any means.
Or is it?
I have listened to this record lord knows how many times and I'm still clueless about whether or not what I feel from this is ""joy"" or not. As you can see by my score, I've come around to believing that this feeling is joy. There's something really powerful about how raw these emotions can be and how the obnoxious musical influences allow those emotions to come through. Somehow. SOMEHOW.
However, these obnoxious influences are still obnoxious and it often walks a very thin line between being powerful and being grating. ""xXXi_wud_nvrst√∏p_√úXXx"" and ""ringtone"" are absolutely those key moments where the forceful, emotional presentation just isn't enough to outweigh the inherently annoying nature of these dated musical tropes. On the other side of the spectrum, ""money machine"" and ""stupid horse"" are some of my favorite tracks of the year so far for just how visceral and intense these sounds get.
This is an album that 100% relies on how fucking hard this band can shove its ideas down your throat. The ideas present are completely polarizing and probably just kind of bad, but because of how fucking intensely these songs are composed and presented, there's a certain heart-wrenching feeling that is communicated through the rippling bass, the screeching synths, and the pounding drums. If that emotion gets through, then it works, but if it doesn't, I'm sorry you had to experience this.",78

TheBravesDH,"Sorry, but 20 gecs is the highest I can go. This seems to take just about everything I dislike in music and wrap it up into an absurd, ear-grating, mercifully short package. It's like Sleigh Bells asked Sophie for some leftover production cuts, Kevin Abstract for some vocal synthesizer tools, and went diving into the bottom Rivers Cuomo's trashcan for unused lyrics. This is going to be a divisive love it or hate it project, but I don't really see it having much lasting impact. I do applaud them for genre-hopping and doing whatever it is they're trying to do.",20
newslang,"1000 gecs pulls sounds from a wide variety of genres and influences. There are elements of dubstep, ska, glitch hop, bubblegum pop, emo pop and industrial. It‚Äôs absurd and in your face with moments that you may say please turn this shit off and others that your left thinking they might be on to something.
The beauty behind a project so absurd as this one is that the songs don‚Äôt last too long or over stay there welcome. The album is very minimal as far as the way its structured. With a length of just over 20 minutes and consisting of 10 tracks every idea is presented quickly but efficiently.
My biggest draw back on this project is although some sounds feel unique and experimental other elements feel very annoying and over the top almost nauseating such as some of the gimmicky production as well as how some of the vocals are presented, pitch shifted and performed like emo pop. I enjoy most of the instrumentation especially the tracks ‚Äúgecgecgec‚Äù and ‚Äú745 sticky‚Äù they display a great variation in musical elements and feel like the perfect example on how the group can succeed in this obscure sound
At its worst the sounds are gimmicky with some vocal performances poorly executed. At its best there is a exhilarating chaos that exists throughout the album, it‚Äôs experimental noisy and overall fun.",65

Funuf,"*1000 gecs* is the 2019 debut release from the music duo known as 100 gecs. Laura Les and Dylan Brady had their share of music escapades before the release of this album, both individually and with the 2017 EP, *100 gecs*, but the release of *1000 gecs* brought them a new massive surge of attention, as the lead single for this project, ""money machine"", caught fire and now sits as just one of a small handful of songs from Les and Brady to accrue millions of streams on platforms like Spotify. I think part of this album's success can be attributed to the steady increase of popularity hyperpop had been garnering at the time, with artists like Charli XCX and the late SOPHIE making releases that would receive critical acclaim and waves of attention. What made this record stand out from the music that those two were making though was the sheer unpredictability of every musical turn in just 23 minutes, with surprising genre blends and walls of noise aplenty.
However, while when compared to other albums, *1000 gecs* is quite the left hook, I actually think its biggest issue can be the predictability within itself. ""745 sticky"", ""money machine"", ""800 db cloud"", ""xXXi_wud_nvrst√∏p\_√úXXx"", and ""gec 2 √ú"" all follow a pretty similar structure of two quick verses, a hook repeated twice, then getting engulfed by wild passages of noise. For those keeping track, that is half of this record's songs, and two of the other ones are interludes. It does result in a couple of the tracks mentioned above lacking much staying power. The album finisher, ""gec 2 √ú"", suffers from this the most, as I think the songwriting here is some of the best on this album, but the production is relatively tame compared to other songs here and the mad dash of crushing synths at the end of the track leaves little impact. Then ""800 db cloud"" is probably my least favorite track of of this record overall, as the overuse of abrasive synths is essentially the inverse of the issue I have with ""gec 2 √ú"". The outcome is the same though, as the song lacks the same creative punch that some of its peers have. Also I find the vocal performances and songwriting to be a little weaker than the rest of *1000 gecs*. The track isn't awful by any means, but I think it's going to be the one I will be revisiting the least.
Luckily, the other aforementioned tracks find ways to be unique despite their similar structures. ""745 sticky"" is this wonky emo-trap inspired cut that generally just spends its time flexing, but the instrumental outro actually serves as the highlight of the song in my opinion. I like the minimalist rendition of the beat of the main leg of the song done with just one twinkling synth before the song closes with wave after wave of crushing synths and random, one-second clips of sound effects. ""money machine"" almost feels like a shitpost in it's performance, as Les' verse is just an angry rant and Brady's verse expresses a similar level of anger. Of all the songs on this albums, I honestly find this one to be the most surprising success, as I think it just manages to be this super catchy banger with a perfect amount of chaotic energy to stick with you after one listen, and I feel like that isn't the strongest explanation I could give. Then there's ""xXXi_wud_nvrst√∏p\_√úXXx"", which manages to make *1000 gecs* the second album I've talked about this year to involve Soulja Boy, as this song interpolates his track, ""Kiss Me Thru The Phone"". However, what I find the most impressive about this track is that it manages to successfully sell itself as the most emotionally potent track on this album, thanks largely to having some of the best vocal lines on the album from both Les and Brady and the production having this sense of emotional desperation that compliments the lyrics and vocals. The twinkling synths and the surprisingly atmospheric nature of the hook, and Brady's verse to an extent, the spiking, dagger-like synths that serve as the post-chorus, and the booming drums at the end of the song through the hazy synths all collide in with Les' and Brady's performance in an unexpectedly beautiful way.
The rest of this album is more diverse in its song structure, and provides its own set of catchy songs. ""stupid horse"", for example, is a ska song. There really isn't a joke to be said here, it's literally a ska song but with added noise that makes it fit the aesthetic that the rest of this album has. It's super catchy, silly, and crazy. I also adore the hook here, as the guitar melody sounds so good here. ""ringtone"" meanwhile is the closes thing to a straightforward pop song from gecs here, which is a clever song about dealing with an obsessive partner on your phone. I like how Les' part and Brady's part work off of each other, with Les' lyrics seeming more ignorant of the problem before Brady swings in over these crushing synths singing about how the ringtone used for this partner now makes the protagonist of this song sick. In general the synths get louder and more abrasive throughout the song, which serves as an appropriate motif for the topic at hand. ""hand crushed by a mallet"" focuses on heartbreak more subtly, but does so by portraying in terms of a music studio. This song conflicts me, because I think it would be one of my favorites if it wasn't for the second half of Brady's performance. His vocals are super muddy and kill the momentum of the song hard, which sucks because I love the first leg of his performance. Les handles her part well from start to finish, as she has some really good vocals here and compounds on the themes set up by Brady. There are also the two interludes I mentioned earlier. Both of which are these random passages of various sounds. I prefer the first one, ""I Need Help Immediately"", as it just manages to be more interesting in my opinion, and I absolutely love the jazzy outro it has. ""gecgecgec"" feels less necessary by comparison, as I don't find the sounds here as interesting and I don't think we needed two of these for such a short album. I did like Les' sung outro though, so the song is far from a complete waste.
With 100 gecs' second album, *10000 gecs*, on the horizon, I am intrigued in what the duo have in store. The two songs they've released so far that appear to be intended for this release, ""mememe"" and ""Doritos & Fritos"", are noticeably different from anything on their last endeavor. The production and lyrics are still chaotic, but there seems to be a more focused approach in song structure that shapes this release to be more accessible than anything the two have made prior. Les and Brady also seemed to have both improved drastically on their vocal abilities, which will hopefully prevent hiccups like ""800 db cloud"" from happening again. As we transition into this new level of exponential growth from the gecs, I think it's important to not forget that their debut was really creative in it's genre mixes and absurdist qualities. It's a kind of project we may not see again, at least to the level of popularity that *1000 gecs* ended up gaining.

rosemulet,"This album utterly confuses me. It tries news things. Some of them are great and innovate the music scene in new and exciting ways. Others are audio torture and are some of the worst music I've ever heard in my life. Some of the musical choices are BAFFLING
If you're neurotypical, don't listen to this.
1. 745 sticky
Fine song for the 1st half. Then it gets weird and loses me.
2. money machine
Absolute banger. And no I'm not even ashamed. this is a BOP! last 15 seconds are weird and awful but for a gec song that's better than what I expected.
3. 800db cloud
This album's idea of ""extremely loud bass"" is not for me. It can work sometimes on rare occasions, but usually I don't like it. But the melodies are catchy and I actually liked most of the song. The last 30 seconds are really fucking weird and they lose me there too.
4. I Need Help Immediately
This is just a bad song. It's literally just noise. It barley feels melodic. Just like a kid randomly putting sounds together. It doesn't sound good, one of the worst songs I've ever heard WOW!
5. stupid Horse
One of the singles I think, it's not money machine, and I don't think its as good as other people do, but it's still one of the better songs on the album I think?!
6. xXXi_wud_nvrst√∏p_√úXXx
Up until the drop, this was amazing. One of my favorites on the album. But then that drop comes and its one of the worst drops ever. Then the 2nd verse comes on and it sounds amazing again. then they mess up the autotune on the chorus for some reason and the 2nd drop sucks just like the 1st drop did. Then at the last 30 seconds it actually almost sounds good?! this build up is very interesting. This could've been AMAZING.
7. ringtone
Cute little low-key bop. It doesn't have as much of what makes the other songs unlistenable at times. I can actually sit through and enjoy the whole thing. But as an actual song, the highs here aren't as high as some of the other songs.
8. gecgecgec
Why. Just...Why... This might be even worse than I Need Help Immediately. It just spams the word gec over and over again for some reason. This is very bad. At least this has a somewhat decent vocal part here. It's still not good though.
9. hand crushed by a mallet
Another absolute BANGER. I am so impressed by this song. I think I might even like this even better than money machine. For years I've wanted to make an unofficial soundcloud remix and call it ""hand crushed by a mulet"" Everything they do here they do perfectly. Why can't the whole album be like this? Not a single bad part of this song. None of it is annoying weird or bad.
10. gec 2 √ú
Starts off fine, but after the drop it becomes the one of the worst parts of this album. The last minute of this song is so weird and bad.
I'll give it props for trying something new and sometimes striking gold, but most of the time it misses, and it misses HARD!
Best songs: hand crushed by a mallet, money machine, the good sounding parts of xXXi_wud_nvrst√∏p_√úXXx
(Stupid Horse and Ringtone are fine, but they're not standouts on the album for me.)
Worst songs: I Need Help Immediately, gecgecgec, the last minute of gec 2 √ú, the bad sounding parts of xXXi_wud_nvrst√∏p_√úXXx, the last minute of 745 sticky, the last 45 seconds of 800db cloud.
4 1/2 good songs out of 10. The rest are terrible. 45/100 feels right. Hand crushed by a mallet and money machine being as good as they are single handedly put this album up 20-25 points from where it would otherwise be. Those 2 songs save this album.",45

I cannot wait for 10000 gecs, especially if it's half as good as mememe!

AcidDrive,"I abstained from listening to this album for two and a half years after its release simply because of my hatred of hyperpop, but, one 2022 night, I was bored enough that I figured I'd give this a shot. And what do I get for my troubles? An actually decent album. Don't get me wrong, a landmark album this is not, and it doesn't even reach the quality standards set by our lords and saviors 3OH!3 by the godsend that is Want, but I can definitely see the appeal.Of course, it'd be easy for me to call this album a bunch of token words, like ""disjointed"", ""messy"", ""noisy"", but unlike most other albums that get those words thrown at them, this one definitely has an intention in its unconventionality. This album feels like what'd happen if Butthole Surfers had a MySpace account, and I mean that as no small compliment. It isn't an album for everyone, and they know goddamn well that it isn't, so they just say ""fuck it"" and throw everything at the wall, much like Gibby's band did way back then, just that their forte is pop instead of rock.Would it be fair to call this ""noise pop""? Apparently not, but I'd definitely consider it a noise pop album. Maybe not by its supposed definition (which sounds like shoegaze with extra steps), but most certainly by its literal definition (loud, aggressive pop). It's a sensory overload in almost every way, almost to the point of feeling like an onslaught of noise, and yet with the way everything clashes with each other it almost does a full U-turn into being genuinely cohesive.All this without mentioning just what they've thrown onto said wall; you've got gabber (xXXi_wud_nvrst√∏p_√úXXx), dubstep (745 sticky), ska (stupid horse), and whatever the fuck I Need Help Immediately and gecgecgec are. There are very few rest stops throughout this album, but when there are, they're almost always brief and followed *immediately* by noise, noise, and more noise. It's a brief trip down a very strange road (the album clocks in at a meager 23 minutes), but with everything that happens along the way, you shockingly start to take in all the sights and appreciate them for what they are.Though the album has its weak spots (the hits of the album {stupid horse, money machine, and ringtone} are all middling in comparison to the other songs), respect to Laura and Dylan for throwing literally everything at the wall and not giving a fuck what sticks and what doesn't. I probably won't return to this album ever again, and I doubt this album did anything to quell my ever growing hatred for hyperpop or even understand how the hell the kids are listening to that type of stuff, but goddammit I'll take this over the generic ""bubblegum emo rap"" hyperpop I kept seeing when I still used SoundCloud any day of my life. Cheers, hopefully these two don't have their own Weird Revolution in a few years' time.",80

Edit: i feel like this album gets better everytime i liste√± to it",90
minhlukk,it's actually 1000gecs/100 but there not be enough decimal so there you go,80
SoundOwl,"1000 gecs by 100 gecs is certainly not for everyone, and will most certainly be written off as a meme band or a bad joke that not many will see the merit in. I am here to try and offer my perspective on this music the best I can and why they should be taken seriously.
This project is fresh. Quite honestly, I've never heard anything quite like it. Stylistically it combines elements of bubblegum bass, pop-punk, ska, glitch, and sound collage among many others. All of the vocals are super processed, but less because of a crutch and more for effect. The album is also incredibly short, being able to be consumed in less than 25 minutes.
All of this adds up to a zany off the walls listening experience with bold sounds and inventive sonic creations.Laura Les and Dylan Brady are basically geniuses in their craft.
The opening track 745 Sticky reads like a wacked out trap banger with a demented instrumental but catchy flows and bizarre lyrics, while the back half of the track shows off the left turns to expect sonically of this band. You get a blasted out breakdown with various sounds thrown in, it's quite humorous as well as hard which is a combo I greatly appreciate.
Money Machine is probably one of the catchiest tunes here, and an intro that will turn your head as it starts. It's got more of that blown out production and nice crunchy bass synths to back up the incredibly catchy main hook of this song.
Stupid Horse is a frikkin Ska track (complete with pickitups) about disrupting a horse betting race and running away with one of the steeds lmao. The funniest song here for sure. Ringtone is another great song with super cute and sentimental lyrics, and it's also probably the most radio friendly despite everything but even still, it's a great tune that fits nicely in the track list.
Gecgecgec is a meme song on the surface, but hidden underneath their maniacal production chops is a cute song about friendship and about being there for your friends even if they can't help as well as they want. This segues into what I think is this album's true hidden gem and that's the songwriting. The whole thing is easy to be distracted by with it's singles and crazy production, but underneath it all and especially on the deep cuts you have songs about some really touching topics and even show a lot of vulnerability in our songwriters thoughts and feelings. Sometimes it's covered up, sometimes it's on display (per 800db cloud) but it all adds up to something special.
The record sure as shit ain't gonna appeal to everybody, but the talent for thinking outside the box is there and for the open minded this record will either grow on you, or it might even win you over immediately. Either way, I do definitely recommend it for those needing something new. It's a lot of fun to come back to and it's short run time makes for easy repeated listens.

Savv2538,"Pretty solid debut from these two, thought the production and singing was very unique and pretty solid. Only major critique I really have with this is the songwriting side of things, I don't think Dylan or Laura are bad songwriters but a lot of seems pretty leaning to the mainstream but luckily there Laura's heavy autotuned voice and Dylan's great production makes up for this flaw. I think 100 Gecs have a lot of potential and could make an even better project, as a debut though this thing is great and shows massive potential. They are a very special group who create weird spacey hyperpop sounds while at the same time using heavy autotune to make a nice atmosphere which makes for some very solid hyper/electric pop music. This album really is unlike anything else in the hyperpop and electropop landscape. Dylan and Laura are pulling this sound off so well that I think without a doubt could make something bigger and better, all I can hope for is that they capitalize on the potential they showed on this on there sophomore album

KaneSeatHeadrest//TouringAmmos,"They really put on their best Dr Evil impression and said ""why should we have 100 gecs when we can have 1000 gecs"" and it shows. This album is like 10 times more gecs than we have ever seen gecs be before and I feel like the attention it got from a large some of the world that expanded out to the likes of Patrick Stump of Fall Out Boy fame that all eyes are on gecs to try and out gecs the gecs they've presented on this consistent display of gecs inspired hits. Each song is more gecs than the last and while hyperpop is the closest thing we can relate to gecs in the grand scheme of gecs I feel like gecs has brought more to the table that has not only helped reinforce the staples of the hyperpop label but displays a gecs like amount of range that has shown that hyperpop and gecs alike cannot and will not be put into a box. They can blend the tropes of that genre with even more refreshing blends of sounds inspired by Ska, Pop Punk, Hip Hop, and Piss Baby-esque dynamics. While it's been important in the growth of hyperpop its a bit of a catch 22 cuz not being put in the category of hyperpop will be crucial to the growth of gecs. So I declare we make a petition to legally classify 'gecs' as an official new genre of music, much like how Primus is literally considered their own genre by the board of people who have legimitised and archived the table of genre classifications (that Primus thing is true look it up, gecs deserve the same respect and I'm not kidding about that either) 
Imagine them on Fueled By Ramen, that would be the most based shit Fueled By Ramen has ever done. This is also just a dream of mine though. 
There next album is really gonna solidify there staying power cuz as incredibly infectious this album has become it gonna take about 10,000 amounts of gecs to reensure us that this group has the staying power that it feels like they do, cuz this could they have a sophomore slump still to overcome so we know this is a fluke. But I for one believe in them. 
This album is incredible but it's just shy of being a 90-100/100. It Could a little bit of GFOTY vomit on this album to really push it into meme legend status. If only they would make some kind of remix album to it. Nah that's silly. 
I really do love this album guys.

As most people were, I was very hesitant to check these two out, because I thought money machine and stupid horse were just shitposts. But I heard 745 sticky, and the bass drop in the track changed my whole outlook on the gecs. Yeah, it's kind of a shitpost. But it also kinda slaps for how wild of a sound combination it creates. I view this album as a comedy album, to laugh with it at how absurd the production is. Although I'd be lying if some moments weren‚Äôt unironically good to me, such as hand crushed by a mallet.

javierlobe,"Dylan Brandy y Laura Les forman un d√∫o americano experimental cuyo trabajo me recuerda al de PC Music (de hecho A. G. Cook les ha hecho alg√∫n remix). Tras un peque√±o EP de 13 minutos en 2016, presentaron el pasado mayo un peque√±o disco de 23 minutos muy divertido:
1. 745 sticky ‚òÖ El comienzo del disco me recuerda al de ‚ÄôNext Level Charli‚Äô de Charli XCX (producida tambi√©n por A. G. Cook). Lo m√°s destacable es el efecto de voces distintas: en lugar de participar un d√∫o en la canci√≥n, parece que hay muchos m√°s personajes involucrados (de hecho Dylan canta sobre poder con todo y sobre no poder con nada con voces distintas). Cuando se aproxima el final de la canci√≥n un hay √©xtasis instrumental fant√°stico.2. money machine ‚òÜ Este fue el primer single y, tras la anterior, me parece una canci√≥n bastante simplona. Laura es la que m√°s canta en ella y comienza siendo divertida: ‚Äúhey mierdecilla, ¬øte crees guay? Tus brazos son muy cuquis, parecen cigarrillos. Apuesto a que podr√≠a fumarte y te encantar√≠a"".3. 800db cloud ‚òÜ Esta canci√≥n me ha parecido una especie de canci√≥n de banda pop adolescente y noventera con una producci√≥n llevada al extremo. El final es lo que menos me ha convencido, un poco death metal. Aqu√≠ hablan de la marihuana que se fuman por un mal de amores.4. I Need Help Immediately ‚òÜ Aqu√≠ parecen estar bajo los efectos de la marihuana. Es un interludio muy corto y pr√°cticamente instrumental, tan experimental como sinsentido.5. stupid horse ‚òÖ Por lo que he le√≠do, escribieron esta canci√≥n como cr√≠tica al capitalismo y en ella se lamentan de apostar dinero a un caballo perdedor de carreras. Frustrados, pegan al jinete del caballo, le roban el tel√©fono y huyen con el corcel. Me ha parecido mucho m√°s adictiva que las anteriores. Algunos medios la comparan con la cabecera de la serie de Scooby Doo, interpretada por Simple Plan (a este feeling me refer√≠a yo antes).6. xXXi_wud_nvrst√∏p_√úXXx ‚òÖ Resulta una canci√≥n muy trance de los 00s, y la letra es una carta de amor. Me encanta que mezclen g√©neros y jueguen tanto con las tomas de voz.7. ringtone ‚òÖ Esta canci√≥n tiene para m√≠ el estribillo m√°s adictivo de todos. Laura canta que en su m√≥vil suena una melod√≠a personalizada para cuando la llama su chico. Cuando termina la canci√≥n, Dylan confiesa que ha terminado aborreciendo ese tono de llamada.8. gecgecgec ‚òÜ Otro instrumental demasiado experimental. Debe resultar muy divertido hacer esto en un estudio, probar y probar y terminar creando una producci√≥n as√≠. En ella Laura recuerda a su pareja que aunque √©l pueda contar con ella es tan humana como el resto y no puede prometerle un bienestar infinito.9. hand crushed by a mallet ‚òÜ Al parecer, lo de hacer m√∫sica tranquilamente es un talento innato en Laura que provoca mucha frustraci√≥n en otros. Creo que es la m√°s aburrida de todas.10. gec 2 √ú ‚òÖ Creo que terminan el disco hablando de su relaci√≥n y lo importantes que resultan el uno para el otro. Es la canci√≥n m√°s larga del disco (de s√≥lo 3:18), y lo m√°s emocionante es el cierre.
Conclusi√≥n: seguramente escuche algunas canciones de este disco cuando necesite un subid√≥n. Aunque nada me suene a nuevo, s√≠ que me suena atractivo. La producci√≥n me ha parecido una aventura envidiable y adictiva, aunque dada su duraci√≥n, su intenci√≥n y su g√©nero, le encuentro m√°s sentido como experimento que como √°lbum al uso.",60

kickflip4jesus,"this album is pure chaos. and though i can see why some would hate it, i absolutely love it. and honestly i have difficulty finding the words to explain why. its a strange, chaotic mash of genres ranging from Nightcore, Dubstep, Ska, Trap, Pop, Emo, Hip Hop, the list goes on. its as if you combine several foods that sound unlikely to be good together but turns out to be amazing. now this approach to making an album definitely has been done before (a simple search of the term Hyperpop will prove this), i think the duo really pushed this style to a new limit that im honestly excited to see what its future holds. and with something as experimental as it is, there were certain songs that really missed for me, but the ones that didnt miss honestly make up for it, and if they didnt have the tracks that missed on here, i easily would have given this a 100. i like it that much.

This album is just extreme joy. The production on it is through the roof and is just so exciting to listen to every second of it. The strange interludes felt slightly unnecessary to me and that is what makes the album score not in the 90's for me. The vocal performances on this album are also incredible. There's so much to love on here, everyone should at least give it one listen. My favourite tracks include 'hand crushed by a mallet,' 'stupid horse,' and 'ringtone.'",88

biglasagnayeet,"EDIT: Yeah, now it's a little too weird for me. Some of the sounds just sound super annoying and distracting for me now. 
""1000 gecs"" is definitely unlike anything I've ever heard before. Dylan Brady and Laura Les, the duo behind 100 gecs, really take experimental to a whole new level with this LP. The constant, glitchy sounds are constantly in-your-face, which works on most songs, but for the song here and there it's really distracting. This album doesn't really feel too concerned about lyrics; it seems mostly focused on putting out this new sound. Fortunately, it does that just fine, so I don't really care about that whole affair. This album is definitely not for everyone, it's really bombastic style can be quite off-putting for some. But for me, it worked quite effectively, making for a very intriguing half-hour.

He's produced and sung some incredible songs in the past. On my first listen of 1000 gecs I was surprised and didn't know what to think honestly. This is not the type music Dylan put out in his past and I didn't expect it. I liked a handful of songs as they were fun and had some meme elements to it. Weeks after the release, one of the songs played on shuffle, I think 8000db and it sounded completely different to me as I didn't remember it was 100 gecs and listened to it without any expectations. It just grew on me since then. I keep coming back to it every few days, it's my most listened to Album on Spotify right now. And I'm glad I got introduced to Laura les thru 100 gecs.

jslat717,"1000 gecs is not only one of the best albums of 2019, it is also one of the most fun and off-the-wall listening experiences I've ever had. This album is eccentric, bizarre, hilarious, ridiculous, sometimes overwhelming, sometimes unsettling, and often borderline stupid. All in the best way possible. It's also just downright addictive. The chipmunked vocals that the duo employs are silly and charming and makes this album so fun to listen to. The two tracks featuring complete mishmashes of nonsensical synths, cartoonish vocals, and random sound effects straight out of a retro video game, add a huge amount of character to the album. Additionally, the duo's ability to explore so many different styles and genres without taking themselves seriously makes for an album that demands repeat listens. And I've listened to it dozens and dozens of times by this point. This album's replay value is insane. 
Let me emphasize this album's masterful execution of a variety of genres and sounds, because I think that's where the album's strengths truly shine. Don't let me be misleading though, this is primarily an experimental pop/electronic album that takes inspiration from the sounds of PC Music, especially bubblegum bass and deconstructed club. But on top of those sounds, it dabbles in dubstep, punk, metal, emo, rock, and ska in the most brilliant and creative way. And the songs that stay in their electropop/bubblegum bass lane are sweet, hard-hitting, and anthemic.
This album isn‚Äôt for everybody, there‚Äôs no doubt about that. The fact that this album is really just downright ridiculous and over-the-top and stupidly cartoonish will turn off a lot of people and that‚Äôs understandable. I think a lot of criticism that the album receives is understandable. I can‚Äôt deny it, it‚Äôs a stupid album. Some say it‚Äôs experimental for the sake of being experimental. I get it. But I think the fact that it knows it‚Äôs a stupid album is what makes it so enjoyable. It isn‚Äôt supposed to be taken seriously, it‚Äôs meant to be unequivocally and nauseatingly fun. I don‚Äôt know, it just works for me. 
Favorite track: 745 sticky 
The opener, 745 sticky, is the most perfect example of both the album‚Äôs eccentricity and venture into a variety of sounds. Most of the song is spent as a hyper and braggadocious pop song, but it quickly evolves into these sweet, plinky, child-like synths backed by a chanted ‚Äúhey hey hey,‚Äù as if you‚Äôre in a raunchy club for the Teletubbies. The song then promptly devolves into a completely manic and unhinged dubstep outro packed full of random sounds ‚Äî like barks, sirens, and blood-curdling screams. It‚Äôs absolutely bonkers, rather unsettling, a little horrifying, and I absolutely love it. Not only do I think 745 sticky is one of the best songs of 2019, I think its outro is one of my favorite music moments of all time. It puts a huge smile on my face every time, it is just so over-the-top ridiculous and disgustingly creative.

'money machine' is such a catchy and loud song while '800db cloud' is this somber, heavy industrial track - they even do these screeches to the back end of the track, 'ringtone' is a cute song, gets more aggressive as you go along.

1000 Gecs is a fun collection of songs that incorporate some interesting noises along the way. Sounds including dog barking and water drops to help make this album a pretty unique listen. The only thing that keeps it from being SPECTACULAR is that while it has cool sounds and fun party anthem vibes, as a whole it is pretty by the numbers.

jtrathe,"This album somehow makes literally no sense and perfect sense at the same time. I feel confused while listening, is this even good? Is it one of those it's so bad that it's good type of things? Is it even that? Is it actually just good? Like, the whole thing screams ""I'm a meme don't take me serious"" right, so any analysis I do can be dismissed pretty easily so I'll leave it at this: all the melodies on this album are infectious and catchy, the instrumentals are full of life and super interesting. My brain says I should hate this record, but my heart kinda loves it? It's god awful, it's amazing, both un-listenably ugly and beautiful.

lovecycles,"edit:
ok, now... i really did not see this one growing on me as much as it did. actually, looking back at my original review, i was kinda baffled to see how much a boring person i was to believe this is not a legitimate record. sure, it is stupid, and sometimes annoying and really devoid of any purpose, but that's exactly what makes it so fun
1000 gecs features a such distorted, hellish and downright absurd collection of sounds it gets almost impossible to break down all of the elements that are violently crashed together to form this nightmare of an experience; it feels like an immense amalgation of metal parts amidst bleeding flesh, pulsating and screeching endlessly at dylan and laura's hands
this thing doesn't even have a proper structure. like, yes, some songs here have a more melodic, acessible touch to them, but for the majority of times, 1000 gecs is just a bodiless collage of edm, noise and industrial, wickedly twisted to achieve a pop like appeal. absolutely insane, it forgets any sense of logic from start to finish, and you just have to be really fucking boring to not appreciate this in 2020

original review:
i've heard quite a few positive things about this record, so i thought imma just check it out. now, after finishing it, i REALLY don't know where all the praise and hype i've seen for this thing is coming from.
sure, it's experimental and different. it's twisted, we have a lot of noisy electronic going on, as well some interesting use of glitch, and the production really is great. but that doesn't mean the record is good as a whole.
this doesn't even feel like an album, like a body of work. it feels like a poorly put together collection of songs with no sense of purpose or anything to sustain it. the lyrics are dull. the autotune, even though it's kinda fun in the first three tracks, gets really tiring. 1000 gecs tries so hard to be wild and shocking that it just end up being boring and unimpressive.
different or unique does not equal good, and 100 gecs is the proof of it.

lucaslucaslucas,"I had already listened to and thoroughly enjoyed 'money machine' however when I fully listened to the album I was surprised at just how much I really enjoyed this album. Surprisingly good lyrics for what felt at first like mostly an ""all aesthetic no substance"" album. This sounds like if a frequent deviant art user from 2009 was thrown into a studio without any knowledge of how to use music software and had to make an album. And I love it.
It's a bit gimmicky and some instrumentation seems to rely on just random noise without any forethought but overall a pretty compelling project.

Am1rrad,"if you're above a certain age, you definitely remember the 2009-2012 era when the dubstep fever was really a thing,mostly pushed by skrillex's music.Though by no means this is comparable to the dubstep craze,reading all the user reviews here I can't help but reminisce myself banging my head against the wall with those sounds.And just like that,I feel the same for this.Throw all the crazy sounds you can into every particular song and expect some type of magic as outcome...The difference is at least those dubstep sounds had some type of melody or harmony to them,this is totally soulless and only enjoyed if you look at it as a (pretentious) new edgy different vibe.This is utter crap.How y'all feel about dubstep after 5 6 years?

DCCXX,"This album is all over the place in the very best way. Warbled autotuned vocals that sound very Bladee-inspired clash abrasively with noisy bubblegum bass, almost dubstep-sounding crunkcore that wouldn't sound out of place in a 2012 YouTube gaming montage. 1000 gecs has so many overlapping ideas and weird detours, but they all feel strangely cohesive. The first half has more quality moments than the second half, but this is still definitely one of the best and strangest experimental releases I've heard this year.

Dylan Brady seriously confuses me. Because the production on this album is unbelievably well done. But it‚Äôs arranged in kind of a satirical manner?

By about the 4th listen I realized this album's catchiness is what impresses me most. Yes, the lyrics are silly, the music and vocals are often obnoxious, and none of this really in an artsy way, but in a more fun and silly way, which I believe to be intentional, and thus not something to be upset about. 
Some music is meant to simply be enjoyed and I enjoy this a great deal, what else can I say? If you like diverse, zany, high-energy music I think you'd have a good time with this album too.",86

Instead we get some incredible tracks that take on so many different sounds that shouldn‚Äôt work but end up doing so with flying colors, and a few attempts at being ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù that just sound like them throwing a bunch of sound effects together and calling it a day.

steadyrhythms,"this is gorgeously absurd. it feels like I‚Äôm listening to a heavily pop influenced brockhampton crossed with death grips, which is probably the most Fantano fan comparison ever but hey i don‚Äôt say clipping. or jpegmafia sound like death grips.
i mean the best thing you can say about this record or whatever it wants to call itself is that it is absolutely insane. it sounds like the biggest ‚Äúscrew you‚Äù to a listener ever. it‚Äôs pretty hilarious at times, and at other times it is nearly unbearable (xXXi_wud_nvrstop_√úXXx being a prime example). some of the songs actually kind of work as legitimate songs too, which is pretty remarkable considering this thing is trying to be the biggest meme ever.
there are a lot of intriguing ideas on this album, and a lot of the time they don‚Äôt mesh together and i believe that‚Äôs the point, which is what makes it so comical. listen to gecgecgec and I Need Help Immediately for example, they‚Äôre just a complete mess for the majority of the song, with snippets that sound like if they weren‚Äôt being thrown in an absurd manner, they‚Äôd actually be pretty sick, but the way they piece everything together here, it can‚Äôt help but be hilarious. is that good or bad? who knows, i don‚Äôt at least.
i really see this as some sort of musical satire, making fun of pop, pop rap, and good lord maybe just anything. this is certainly going to go down as one of the most interesting releases of this year. just complete absurd, weirdness.",70
